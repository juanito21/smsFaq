*Is medical expense coverage available for substance abuse and mental illness?
Major medical expense plans also generally provide coverage for treatment of substance abuse (e.g., alcoholism and drug usage) and mental illness. A higher coinsurance percentage (e.g., 50 percent) and a lower lifetime benefit limit (e.g., dollar25,000 or dollar50,000) generally applies, however. In addition, the extent of coverage may depend on whether treatment is provided on an in-patient or out-patient basis. 
*What types of expenditures are commonly excluded under major medical expense plans?
Although providing very broad coverage, major medical plans typically contain a number of exclusions. Common exclusions include medical expenditures arising from: (1) convalescent or custodial care; (2) physical examinations, unless required for the treatment of an injury or illness (it should be noted that some plans now cover this expenditure); (3) cosmetic surgery unless required to correct a condition resulting from an injury or a birth defect; (4) occupational injuries and illnesses that are otherwise covered under a Workers' Compensation law; and (5) routine dental and vision care (care required for treatment of an injury and dental and eye surgery are frequently covered, however). Other common exclusions relate to benefits provided by government agencies (e.g., VA hospitals) and expenses paid under other insurance programs, including Medicare.

*Even though major medical plans provide broad coverage, insureds still incur certain out of pocket costs. What are these costs?
An insured's out of pocket costs under major medical expense plans include the deductible, cost sharing amounts arising from the operation of the coinsurance clause, and medical expenditures that are deemed by the plan to be in excess of reasonable and customary charges. Only charges that are reasonable and customary for a specific type of service, in a particular location or geographic area, are eligible for reimbursement under medical expense plans. The definition of reasonable and customary may vary somewhat from one medical expense plan to another.

*What is the coinsurance clause in medical expense plans and how does it work?
Coinsurance, sometimes called percentage participation, requires the insured to share in the cost of medical care. Under an 80/20 coinsurance provision, the medical expense plan pays 80 percent of eligible medical charges above any deductible. The insured is required to pay the remaining 20 percent. Other coinsurance arrangements, e.g., 70/30 or 90/10, are sometimes used. In the event of large or catastrophic medical expenses, an insured might suffer severe financial hardship due to the operation of the coinsurance clause. To compensate for this possibility, many major medical expense plans contain a coinsurance cap, or stop loss limit. This provision places a limit on the insured's out of pocket costs in a given year arising from the operation of the coinsurance clause. The size of the coinsurance cap generally ranges from dollar 2,000 to dollar 3,000, depending on the plan, although limits as low as dollar 1,000 are sometimes used. Once the coinsurance cap has been reached, all eligible expenses above this amount are paid in full, up to the plan's overall limit of coverage.

*What is the difference between coinsurance and copayment?
On occasion, these terms have been used interchangeably. However, it is preferable to define the two terms differently, despite their similarity of purpose. Under a copayment or copay provision, the insured usually is required to pay a set or fixed dollar amount (e.g., dollar 3, dollar 5, or dollar 10) each time a particular medical service is used. Copay provisions are frequently found in medical plans offered by health maintenance organizations (HMOs) where a nominal copayment is applied to each office visit and to each prescription that is filled.

*What is a preexisting conditions clause and what is the effect of its inclusion in major medical expense plans?
A preexisting condition is often defined as a medical condition (i.e., an injury or illness) that required treatment during a prescribed period of time, e.g.,  or  months, prior to the insured's effective date of coverage under the major medical expense plan. Sometimes, a preexisting condition is defined to include medical conditions that were known to the insured, even though no treatment was provided during the prescribed period. A preexisting conditions clause excludes coverage for preexisting conditions for possibly as long as  months after the effective date of coverage. Because the definition of a preexisting condition, and the provisions of the clause itself, may differ considerably from one plan to another, it is recommended that newly insured individuals (and prospective insureds) completely familiarize themselves with this policy provision.

However even if insurance is not required for visa purposes, it is still prudent to purchase health insurance for the following reason: Health care costs in India are much less when compared to developed countries like the USA, Japan and European countries. In most of these countries medical care is not subsidized by the government, and medical bills can easily exceed thousands of dollars which patients have to pay by themselves.

*Why is it harder to get insurance if drivers in my household have bad driving records?
Many companies will not insure you if you live with a relative who has a poor driving record. If your teenager has a poor driving record, you may have trouble getting a preferred rate because he or she is defined as an insured under your policy. Some companies will exclude this person by name from the insurance policy. Many companies will not insure anyone in the family unless every driver in the household meets their requirements. 

*How does my driving record affect my insurance premium?
The premium you pay is a direct reflection of your driving record for the past three to five years depending on the insurance company. Insurance companies order driving records from the DMV of your residence state and from other states where you've been licensed. Statistics show that drivers with tickets and accidents are more likely to have accidents than drivers with clean records. 

*What is full form of DMV?
In the United States of America, a Department of Motor Vehicles (or DMV) is a state level government agency that administers vehicle registration and driver licensing. Similar departments exist in Canada. The name DMV is not used in every state or province, nor are the traditional DMV functions handled by a single agency in every state, but the generic term is universally understood, particularly in the context of driver's license issuance and renewal.

If you live in an area where you feel that if there was an accident, that was your fault, and property damage may exceed ,, you may want to consider higher limits. Remember, property damage is the other person's car and any other property damaged during the accident if you are at fault. In some areas one's landscaping can cost over ,! 

*Why does my insurance cost more than my agent said it would?
This is called a misquote. Determining your premium depends on many factors, including where you live, the kind of car your drive, how much you drive, how much coverage you want, your driving record, and your age. If an error is made in reporting any of these facts, your rates won't be quoted correctly. Misquotes can also happen if your agent makes a mistake in applying the company's rating system. Auto insurance misquotes can happen when your application information differs from your actual driving record. Companies ask states' motor vehicle divisions to verify the records of drivers they insure. If you told your insurance agent you have a perfect driving record, and you don't, your insurance company will charge higher premiums than your agent quotes. To avoid misquotes, provide accurate information about your driving record and any other facts affecting the cost of insurance, such as the make of your car or how far you commute to work. Verify all information before signing the application. 

*My car was totaled and my policy did not pay what I think my car was worth. Why?
 Most auto insurance policies pay the actual cash value (ACV) of a vehicle totaled in an accident. The ACV is equal to the market value of an auto immediately before the accident. Insurers must use a fair and reasonable method to determine the value of your car. If you have concerns about their decision you may be able to negotiate with your insurer by telling them why your car may have had more value that what the insurance company originally determined. 

*What happens if my loan was more than my insurance company says my car was worth?
Sometimes the value of a car is less than the balance on your car loan. There can be several reasons for this. Interest rate changes may have increased the amount of your loan. Rebates may not have been applied to the purchase price, or poor maintenance of the auto may have reduced its value. The insurance company bases its payments on the actual cash value (ACV) of the car, not the amount of your loan. In some states you may be able to purchase a special type of insurance, known as guaranteed auto protection (GAP), when you buy a car. GAP insurance covers the difference between the ACV and your loan balance. 

*My teenager just got his license, but I do not allow him to drive my car. Does he need to be insured?
In most cases, yes. Automobile insurance policies require every licensed person in your household to be listed on your insurance policy unless they have a completely separate policy of their own. This includes a teenager who just received their licence or a college student who still uses your address as their residence and/or visits regularly on weekends, vacations, etc. 

*What do insurance companies consider when they decide whether to cancel or not renew policies?
Insurance companies evaluate the risks associated with each policyholder to determine if you are a good risk or if your policy should be canceled or not renewed. Insurance companies, among other factors, will primarily review your claims, driving, and credit history. It is most favorable that your policy will not be canceled if you don't have a history of filing frequent claims, have maintained a clean driving record and your credit history is good with no bankruptcy's. 

*Does everyone have to have auto insurance?
Yes, automobile liability insurance, or proof of financial responsibility is required in all fifty states. Although each state sets their own limits on how much insurance is needed, these are only minimum limits and in most cases additional coverage is needed if you don't want to have to pay additional expenses out of pocket. If you have a lease or loan on your car you are usually required by the lender to have comprehensive and collision coverage in addition to the state  

*Do I Have Insurance Coverage for a Rental Car after a Car Accident?
Having a car accident can be devastating. Not having an extra car available to drive while your car is being fixed can just add to that feeling. A motor club will not guarantee that you have a rental car so you will want to make sure rental car coverage is provided in your car insurance policy. 

*What is the Family Floater Health Insurance Plan?
For the first time in India, one single policy takes care of the hospitalisation expenses of your entire family.

Or the insurer may issue a policy with limitations on coverage. Most group insurance, however, is issued without medical examination or other evidence of individual insurability because the insurer knows that it can cover enough individuals to balance those in poor health against those in good health. The risk of an insurer failing to achieve this balance is diminished as the size of the group increases, or as the insurer underwrites additional group policies and increases the total number of individuals covered. This is known as the law of large numbers.

A preferred provider organization (PPO) is an association that contracts with a group of doctors, dentists, hospitals or other health care service providers to provide care at prearranged rates or discounts. 

*Can an employer work directly with an insurance company?
It is possible for an employer to deal directly with an insurer through a group sales representative to purchase group insurance. Premium rates and underwriting practices vary considerably from one insurer to another, however. In addition, the coverages provided are rarely identical. This means that comparison shopping is often beyond the capability of all but the most sophisticated purchases, for example, the very large company that has sufficient internal employee benefits expertise to do so. For this reason, many group insurance purchasers do not deal directly with insurance company underwriters or group insurance representatives, preferring instead to deal with an intermediary. Smaller employers need a qualified professional to act as intermediary because they lack the resources and expertise to handle their group insurance needs. An intermediary can help them define their needs and objectives, design a plan to meet those criteria, select the proper purchasing and funding vehicle, obtain competitive quotes from insurers and service the plan. 

*What is a risk?
The risk an insurance company assumes when it agrees to cover a particular group is the possibility that claims will exceed the expected level. It is the chance of financial loss inherent in the group. Insurance companies use it to determine whether they will underwrite an insurance policy on a particular group. The spread of risk is necessary not only because of the expected variations in a population's health but also because some policyholders — particulary very small groups — purchase group insurance to cover certain individuals with known health problems. This is a more costly way to obtain coverage for those high risk individuals, but often the only way possible, given the evidence of insurability requirement for individual policies.

This is a more costly way to obtain coverage for those high risk individuals, but often the only way possible, given the evidence of insurability requirement for individual policies. 

*Who is an eligible employee?
An eligible employee is any employee who meets the definition in the plan for participation. Definitions of eligible employee vary widely from employer to employer, though they may be influenced by legal considerations and company structure. 

*Will an insurance carrier deny certain employees coverage under a group health insurance plan?
Generally, insurers will not deny coverage to any full time employee. Inherent in the principle of group insurance is the understanding that all employees can be covered. Most carriers, however, require an employee to be actively at work on the day the employer provider coverage becomes effective, and to have enrolled in a contributory plan within the time required. 

*Are employers required by federal law to purchase group insurance for their employees?
Presently, no federal law requires employers to provide their employee with group insurance. There have been initiatives in Congress, however, that would require employers to provide specified minimum levels of health benefits, and there is every likelihood that some form of national standard will be legislated in the next few years. 

*What is a mandate benefit?
A mandate benefit is a specific coverage that an insurer is required to include in its contract under state law. For example, most states require that coverage for substance abuse treatment be provided. Other kinds of coverage that are mandated in some states include coverage for newborn children, mental and nervous disorders and hospice care. 

*What are the minimum and maximum number of employees allowed by state law to participate in a group health insurance plan?
Most states require that an employer enroll a minimum number of employees (generally ten, though fewer in some states) for coverage in order to purchase and maintain a group health insurance plan. This minimum size requirement reduces the potential for adverse selection. There is no legal limit to the number of employees that may be covered under a group health insurance plan. 

*What is a base plus plan?
A base plus plan is a two part health insurance plan. Basic medical coverage — for such expenses as hospitalization, surgery, physician's visits, diagnostic laboratory tests and x rays — is provided under the first part. There may be limits on these expenses, such as a limited number of hospital days and a surgical schedule, but no deductible or coinsurance applies to the covered expenses. The employee is reimbursed starting with the first dollar of expenses. The second, or major medical, part of the plan covers other health expenses. The coverage is broad, with fewer limits; however, a deductible is required before the employee is reimbursed for expenses. 

*What are the advantages to a base plus plan?
From the employee's point of view, base plus plans appear to provide more generous benefits because of the lack of deductibles and coinsurance in the basic medical part. 

*What is a comprehensive plan and it's advantages?
A comprehensive plan provides coverage for most medical services using one reimbursement formula. In a pure comprehensive plan, a deductible must be met before reimbursement for any covered expenses begins, and coinsurance applies to all covered expenses until the maximum employee out of pocket expense limit is reached. Additional covered expenses are paid in full. Because employees share from the beginning in the cost of their medical expenses when they are incurred, a comprehensive plan encourages them to use more cost effective health care. The patient is more likely to be cost conscious and to seek out more cost effective health care services and providers. 

*What kinds of hospital outpatient expenses are covered?
Three kinds of care are covered: emergency treatment, surgery and services rendered in the outpatient lab or x ray department. 

*What types of services are generally covered by a group health insurance plan?
Base plus and comprehensive plans vary by insurer, but generally cover the same kinds of services. These include: Professional services of doctors of medicine and osteopathy and other recognized medical practitioners Hospital charges for semiprivate room and board and other necessary services and supplies Surgical charges Services of registered nurses and, in some cases, licensed practical nurses Home health care Physiotherapy Anesthetics and their administration X rays and other diagnostic laboratory procedures X ray or radium treatment Oxygen and other gases and their administration Blood transfusions, including the cost of bloom when charged Drugs and medicines requiring a prescription Specified ambulance services Rental of durable mechanical equipment required for therapeutic use Artificial limbs and other prosthetic appliances, except replacement of such appliances Casts, splints, trusses, braces and crutches Rental of a wheelchair or hospital type bed deductibles, copayments and reimbursements 

*What is a deductible?
It is a specific dollar amount that an individual must pay (or satisfy) before reimbursement for expenses begins. The higher the deductible, the lower the cost of the health insurance plan. 

*For insured employees with dependent coverage, does the deductible for each person have to be satisfied before reimbursement begins?
Each person covered under a group health insurance plan must meet a deductible before expenses will be covered. However, plans usually include some type of family deductible in order to limit a family's exposure for health care expenses. The family deductible is usually some multiple of the individual deductible, generally two or three. For the family deductible to be satisfied, the combined expenses of covered family members are accumulated. Some plans require, however, that at least one family member satisfy the full individual deductible before the family deductible can be met. 

*What is coinsurance?
Coinsurance is a feature found in most group health insurance plans. It sets forth the percentage of covered expenses that the employees and the health insurance plan will pay. The most common coinsurance level is one in which the employee pays  percent of the expenses and the insurer pays  percent. This is called  percent coinsurance. 

*What is a covered expense and are there limits?
A covered expense is an eligible expense under a group health insurance plan. A covered expense is an expense incurred by a covered individual that will be reimbursed in whole or in part under the group health insurance plan. For example, under most health insurance plans, doctors' visits are a covered expense. That is, a doctor's fee up to the amount provided by the plan will be reimbursed by the insurer Just because an expense is covered does not mean that the coverage is unlimited. Both base plus and comprehensive plans have limits on the expenses for which they will reimburse. In addition, some form of deductible and coinsurance is often applicable. Insurers limit covered expenses in a variety of ways. One way is to cap allowable payments for a certain procedure or service. A common example of this type of limit would be a surgical schedule. Insurers also restrict covered expenses by limiting the number of visits or days for home health care or skilled nursing care, or by establishing a reasonable and customary charge. 

*Do health insurance plans cover dental care?
Proper dental care has been considered a budgetable expense, so traditionally, it has not been included in group health insurance plans. In the s, as its cost increased, dental care was added to employee benefits plans. Some plans include dental coverage as part of the medical plan; others include dental coverage as a separate plan. However, many health insurance plans do provide coverage for noncosmetic dental work necessary as the result of an accident. Some plans include limited coverage for hospital room and board expenses related to dental procedures, such as removal of impacted wisdom teeth, performed in a hospital. 

*What is direct reimbursement for dental care?
Direct reimbursement is a noninsured dental program in which an employer agrees to pay for a specified percentage or amount of receipted dental expenses. It has been used by smaller employers as a way of avoiding both the costs associated with an insured plan and the administrative complexity that often accompanies insurance company programs. And, since dental expenses are more predictable than medical expenses — seldom involving emergencies or catastrophic expenses — the risk to employers is considerably smaller. 

*Are all types of dental services covered by insurance?
Usually not. Dental services are often divided into different coverage levels. Level I services include semiannual examinations, semiannual cleaning, x rays and diagnosis. Most plans cover at least preventive and diagnostic care. Level II (basic services) includes simple restoration (fillings), crowns and jackets, repair of crowns, extractions and endodontics (root canals and internal pulp treatment). Level III (major services) includes dentures, bridges and replacement of bridges and dentures. In order to emphasize prevention, many plans cover the Level I services at higher reimbursement levels than Level II or III services. 

*How is vision care covered?
Most health insurance plans provide coverage for medical care related to eye injury or disease, but do not cover the costs of periodic eye examinations or corrective lenses. Like dental care, vision care is a relatively new employee benefit, offered by employers that can afford to expand their employee benefits plans to include additional fringe benefits previously considered budgetable. Vision care is most often covered on a scheduled basis that pays a fixed dollar amount for examinations, lenses and frames. Vision care is almost universally noncontributory due to the potential for biased selection. 

*Are all prescription drugs covered under health care plans?
Generally, only prescription drugs that are for treatment of an illness or injury are covered, subject to applicable deductibles and coinsurance. Many plans do not cover contraceptive prescription drugs, for example, or nicotine chewing gum prescribed for smokers who are trying to quit. 

*Are there different types of drug plans?
There are a number of variations, but the principal types of prescription medication plans are open panel, closed panel, mail order and prescription drug card plans. 

*Would I have to fill the form again?
No, you would not have to do so again.

Today, people are more prone to various ailments and health problems due to fast paced lifestyle and erratic schedules. Rising medical cost is a major deterrent, and thus, a higher cover would guarantee you a better protection.

When a premium is paid, an expense charge is immediately deducted and the balance is placed in a cash value fund to earn interest at the current rate. Each month, all insurance expense charges necessary to keep the policy in force are paid internally from the cash value, regardless of whether or not the premium was paid. The cost of insurance will increase each year on the policy anniversary based on the attained age of the insured. This is a non–participating policy on which no dividends are payable. The policy will terminate at any time if the cash surrender value is insufficient to pay the monthly deductions. This can happen due to insufficient premium payments, if loans or withdrawals are made, or if current interest rates or charges fluctuates. Click here for more information about Universal Life.

*Why does an international insurance plan not meet the SHIP waiver criteria?
There are a number of reasons why international insurance plans do not meet the SHIP waiver criteria. Our primary concern is that students are able to receive the medical care that they need. U.S. service providers will not bill outside of the United States. This means that students would have to pay for treatment at the time of service. This is an unreasonable barrier to students getting access to care. In addition, insurance mandates and standards set forth by the U.S. federal and state governments do not apply to foreign insurance carriers. Medical treatments that must be covered under federal and state law may not be covered by a foreign policy and if a dispute arises from a claim, U.S. providers cannot enforce or defend a claim with a foreign insurance carrier. Varying currency rates and itemized billing statements in English can also present problems with reimbursement for students. 

*If I have my own insurance, why should I keep SHIP?
Your decision to keep or waive SHIP is a personal choice. While many students have other health insurance, many still opt to keep both their personal health insurance and SHIP. The primary reason students opt to keep SHIP is convenience.

Increasing and Decreasing E amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;O Insurance Policy Limits Wednesday, June ,  General Insurance Many small business owners purchase higher limits on their errors amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; omissions insurance because their client contracts require it. But what about when those contracts expire? Is it a good idea to save a little money by reducing your professional liability policy limits? Or, what if you already have coverage, but a new contract requires a higher policy limit? Can you increase coverage in the middle of the annual policy term? We answer these and other frequently asked errors amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; omissions questions below. 

*Is coverage fixed for an annual period, or can I modify my policy limits during the year?
Policy limits can often be adjusted during the year, though some insurance companies have restrictions regarding this. As a rule, they are willing to increase the limits due to contract requirements, but may request a copy of the contract. Their concern is that your request to increase your coverage amount may be related to an incident that has already occurred, and they do not want to increase the amount of coverage when there is already a potential or pending claim. 

*If I want to increase and decrease E amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;O insurance coverage based on what my contracts say I need, is the coverage limit based on when I delivered the project, or when a suit is brought? If I decrease coverage after the contract ends and am later sued, am I covered based on the level I had at the time I did the work, or on the level of coverage at the time I'm sued?
If coverage is reduced, the claim will be handled based on the amount of coverage in force when the claim is filed, regardless of how much coverage was in force when the work was done. In some cases, when coverage is increased in the middle of the policy term, the carrier will treat claims that occurred prior to the date change as covered under the lower limit, and those events that occurred after the increase as covered with the higher limit. Again, this is to protect against increasing coverage when there is a potential or pending claim that has not yet been filed. 

*If I move E amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;O coverage limits up and down, could the carrier deny me future coverage or drop me?
Probably not. Although making multiple changes in the course of the same policy term is very unusual, it is generally not a cause for nonrenewal. However, as a rule, it is best to maintain a consistent level of coverage during a single policy term, unless a contract specifically requires an increase. Changes in coverage limits are best handled at the policy renewal. 

*If I reduce my coverage or completely let it lapse, would it be harder to later increase or reinstate my coverage?
You should always be able to start a new policy, as long as the previous policy was not canceled for nonpayment of premium. E amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;O insurance policies are written on a “claimsmade” basis. That means that coverage must be in force when the event occurred, as well as when the claim is filed. With few exceptions, once an E amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;O policy lapses, all coverage is lost, and it is as if you never had insurance. When your policy lapses and a new policy is started, the new policy will only cover work that is done after the new policy's effective date. There is no coverage for work that was done prior to that date, even though you might have had coverage in force at that time. 

*How do I determine how much errors and omissions coverage I need?
It is difficult, if not impossible, to predict exactly how much errors and omissions coverage you might need under future circumstances. When helping you determine limits, we assess your exposure to risk based on the size of the contracts you work on – small contracts typically suggest lower maximum liability – and how missioncritical your services are to the client. For example, you might be working on a small project, but a failure could result in your client being unable to process business orders or do payroll. Depending on the size of the client, the financial loss could be substantial. In general, dollar  million in coverage is the most common amount required by contracts and is the amount we suggest most often.

*What is a 'keyman insurance policy'?    
There is no legal definition. In general, it has the following features. An employer takes out an insurance policy insuring against loss of profits arising from the death, sickness or injury of a key employee. The beneficiary is the employer. In the case of a life insurance policy, it is a term insurance, covering the life of the employee within the term of the policy, with no other benefits. The term does not extend beyond the period of the employee's usefulness to the employer. The purpose of taking out the insurance is to compensate the employer for the loss of trading income that may result from the loss of the service of the key employee in case of death, sickness or injury.     

*Are the premiums paid on the policy by the employer deductible for profits tax purpose? Are the proceeds from the policy taxable?    
The premiums are deductible (provided the policy has the features as mentioned in A). The proceeds are taxable as trading receipts of the employer, being compensation for loss of profits.     

*If the employer is a sole proprietor or a partnership and the insured person is the sole proprietor or a partner, are the premiums paid on the policy by the employer deductible? Are the proceeds from the policy taxable?    
No, the premiums are not deductible. Even though the policy may be named as a 'keyman policy', the Department would not accept that it is a real keyman policy as described in A above. This is because a keyman policy is applicable only in the case of an employer and employee relationship. A sole proprietor or partner is not an employee. The premiums are regarded as private expenses. The proceeds are not taxable.     

*If the employer is a limited company and the insured person is a director who owns substantial shares in the company, are the premiums paid on the policy by the employer deductible? Are the proceeds from the policy taxable?    
No, the premiums are not deductible. The situation is, in substance, similar to the case where the insured keyman is the sole proprietor or a partner. The Department considers that the purpose of the policy is to protect the value of the shares because the life or wellbeing of the director, being the keyman, would significantly affect the value of the shares. The premiums are of a capital nature. In this connection, generally a shareholding of % would be regarded as substantial. The proceeds are not taxable. 

*If the proceeds of a keyman insurance policy are payable to the family members of the employee or the employer is contractually required to pay the proceeds to the family members of the employee, are the premiums paid on the policy by the employer deductible? Are the proceeds from the policy taxable?
No, the premiums are not deductible. The purpose of the policy is not to compensate the employer's loss of profits, but to protect the family of the employee. The proceeds received by the employee's family are not taxable. 

*If the policy is not a term policy, but is a life policy carrying a surrender value or an endowment policy, are the premiums paid on the policy by the employer deductible? Are the proceeds from the policy taxable?
No, the premiums are not deductible. They are regarded as expenditure of a capital nature. The proceeds are not taxable.     

*Sometimes, the policy may have an addon element. For example, the employer pays extra premiums on top of the normal premiums so that on the death of the employee certain benefits (e.g. one year salary) would be paid to the family members of the employee. Are the whole premiums paid on the policy by the employer deductible? Are the proceeds from the policy taxable?    
Only the normal premiums are deductible. The extra premiums are not deductible. The proceeds received by the employer are taxable. The proceeds received by the family members are not taxable.     

*If the policy is an investmentlink policy, are the premiums paid on the policy by the employer deductible? Are the proceeds from the policy taxable?    
The premiums for the investment portion are not deductible because they are of a capital nature. Only the premiums for the risk portion are deductible (provided the policy has the features as mentioned in A). An apportionment of the premiums is necessary. The proceeds relating to the investment portion are not taxable. The proceeds relating to the risk portion are taxable.     

*If the employer is required under the law to pay compensation to the employee on injury or death etc. and the employer takes out an insurance policy to cover such legal obligation (e.g. workers' compensation under the Employment Ordinance), are the premiums paid on such policy deductible? Are the proceeds from the policy taxable?    
Yes, the premiums are deductible, being normal business expenses. Such policy is not a keyman policy. 

*Will the agent be helpful in settling of claims in future?  
Yes your agent will be helpful but he is getting % of his income from the insurance company and he may be getting . % of his income from you. If he has to make a choice he will favour Insurance Company. You are the best person to decide whether directly from the company or through an agent. Theoretically he is supposed to help you in claim settlement but time will tell when the claim is to be lodged. Be positive and buy it through agent but better buy through an Insurance Brokerage Firm as it offers wider choice.   

*What are the minimum and maximum policy durations?  
Minimum is  year. Some companies offer  years duration also.   

*Can I buy more that one Health Insurance policy?  
Yes, you can buy more than one insurance policy but the claim should not be duplicated to two insurance companies. Under normal circumstances the claim amount will be shared by both insurance companies in the ratio of the sum insured. Let us say Company 'A' insured you for Rs.  lakhs and Company 'B' insured you for Rs.  lakhs, then the claim will be shared in the ratio of :. In case you have gone in for a normal policy of Rs.  lakhs from Company A and TopUp policy of Rs  lakhs from United, then in that case first Rs.  lakhs will paid by Company A and the claim above Rs.  lakhs will be paid by United. Top up Policy costs less than normal policy of Insurance Company. For right advice it is always better to consult an Insurance Brokerage Firm.

*What is the difference between term and permanent life insurance?
Term life insurance is typically the least expensive type of coverage, at least initially, and the simplest. These policies do not build up a cash value. Coverage is in effect for a fixed term or period of time, usually one to  years, and typically may be renewed after the initial term. The policy pays your beneficiary a fixed death benefit if you die while the policy is in force. The premiums are lowest when you are young and increase upon renewal as you age. Be sure to check your policy for age or other renewal restrictions. Permanent life insurance includes whole life, universal life and variable universal life insurance. Whole life provides protection as well as a guaranteed cash value. The premiums remain at a fixed level for the duration of the policy. Over time, the policy generally builds up cash value on a taxdeferred basis. Some companies pay a dividend, which is a return of excess premiums. Universal life insurance is a flexible life insurance plan. These policies are interestsensitive and give the owner the option to adjust the death benefit and/or premium payments, within limits, to fit the owner's situation. The net premium payments are applied to the accumulation fund, which earns a guaranteed interest rate. As with whole life insurance, the cash value belongs to the policy owner, who may withdraw it or borrow against it as provided for in the policy. Variable universal life insurance is a life insurance policy that is based on the performance of the financial markets. The policy offers several professionally managed investment options and the policy owner decides how the net policy values are to be invested. The values may accumulate more rapidly than with other cash value policies, but the policy owner incurs additional risk. If market performance is poor, the death benefit may decrease, and/or the policy owner may have to pay higher premiums to keep the policy in effect. As with whole life and universal life policies, policy owners may borrow against or withdraw the cash value at anytime. Loans and withdrawals may reduce cash values and the death benefit. Always read your policy carefully for any possible charges associated with these transactions. Variable universal life insurance policies are sold by prospectus, a valuable disclosure document, that should be read carefully. 

*Is it possible to change my life insurance policy if I already have one?

If you want to increase your total life insurance, it may be wiser to keep your old policy and simply add a new one, or increase your specified face amount under the same life insurance policy. Your existing policy premiums will generally be less than those for a new policy, because you bought it when you were younger and you won't lose any existing cash value. A new policy will contain a contestable clause, which will permit the insurance company the option to contest any material misrepresentation. (The two year period on your current policy's contestable clause may have expired.) Be sure to ask your agent, financial advisor or insurance company about the best alternative for your specific situation.

*What should I do if my premium increases and I want to get quotes from other companies?
Missouri only requires insurers to give you  days notice on your renewal, which often is not enough time. If you need more time, considering paying monthly installments until you make a final decision on your insurer. When shopping around, try to get all your quotes in a twoweek period. Shopping around for insurance coverage can now damage your credit score because each insurer may run a credit check. As best we can tell, getting all your insurance quotes and buying a new policy in a twoweek period increases the chance that you can keep damage to your credit score at a minimum. If you receive a premium notice that doubles your insurance premium on your homeowners policy form the previous year, we encourage you to call the Missouri Department of Insurance, Financial Institutions and Professional Registration at . 

*How can I get a lower premium?
Strongly consider a higher deductible so you can cut your premium. In the current insurance market, don't tempt yourself with the possibility of a small claim, considering that many insurers now refuse to renew polices with a claim history and refuse to accept new customers with prior claims. View your homeowners insurance as catastrophic coverage only, and set aside your premium savings to cover minor repairs. 

*What if I receive a notice of nonrenewal?
Explore whether your company will extend your coverage if you increase your deductible. With many insurers dropping frequent claimants, the higher deductibles will mean fewer claims and, if nothing else, buy time until you have the opportunity to find another insurer. Apply for coverage with several companies simultaneously. Otherwise, you may not have enough time to get competitive bids. This grouping of applications also gives you the best chance of avoiding major damage to your credit score. Ask in advance if a company accepts new applicants with recent claims. Most preferred companies will not insure anyone with one claim in  years. Make every effort to get regular coverage, even though you can expect to pay more than for your current policy. The alternatives in Missouri are the MO Property Insurance Placement Facility (FAIRPLAN), which provides a fire policy (no liability) with no more than dollar , in coverage for your home and contents combined, or the surplus lines market, which seldom insures any home less than dollar , and provides very expensive coverage. If you have a mortgage and your coverage lapses, the finance company or bank may be able to provide insurance and charge you high rates for inadequate coverage; these forced placement contracts only covers its stake in your home's value, not your equity.   I had a loss, and my roof needs repair. The company is only willing to pay for repairing part of the roof even though the contractor has said that I need to replace the entire roof. The company is not responsible for repair or replacement of the roof unless it is damaged by a covered peril (see above for definition of peril). The policy does not provide coverage for repair/replacement that is due to ordinary wear and tear or from lack of maintenance. The company can authorize repair/replacement for just that portion of the roof that was damaged by the covered peril. I have replacement coverage for contents under a homeowner's policy. Some of my property has been stolen. Can the company settle for an amount less than replacement? The company will usually pay the actual cash value, which is the replacement cost minus depreciation, for the loss or damage until the property is replaced. Once the insured replaces the damaged property and provides receipts to the company, the company should reimburse the difference. 

*I have had homeowner's insurance with the same company for years. I had two claims last year, and now the company will not renew my policy. Can they do this?
Yes. Each company has its own underwriting guidelines, which indicate what risks they will assume.

*What is credit scoring?
A credit score is a snapshot of your credit at one point in time. The credit information from your credit report is put through a mathematical formula (credit scoring model) that assigns weights to the various factors and summarizes your credit information into a threedigit number ranging from zero to . Many insurers believe that the lower the number, the more likely the consumer will file a claim. 

*How is credit scoring used?
If your insurance company relies on credit scoring, they may use it in two ways: * Underwriting: Deciding whether to issue you a new policy or to renew your existing policy. * Rating: Deciding what price to charge you for your insurance by placing you into a specific rating tier or level. Some insurers use credit information along with other more traditional rating factors, such as claims history. Other insurers may use credit alone to determine your rate. (A  Missouri law prohibits the use of credit scores solely to decide whether to accept you as an auto or homeowners customer.) Insurance rates based on credit information can vary from company to company; if you think your rate is too high, shop around. 

*What affects a credit score?
Several factors determine credit scores. Each factor is assigned a weighted number that, when applied to your specific credit information and added together, equals your final threedigit score. Following is a list of common factors: * Major negative items: Bankruptcy, collections, foreclosures, liens, chargeoffs, etc. * Past payment history: Number and frequency of late payments. * Length of credit history: Amount of time you've been in the credit system. * Homeownership: Whether you own or rent. * Inquiries for credit: Number of times you've recently applied for new accounts, including mortgage loans, utility accounts, credit card accounts, etc. * Number of open credit lines: Number of major credit cards, department store credit cards, etc., that you've actually opened. * Type of credit in use: Major credit cards, store credit cards, finance company loans, etc. * Outstanding debt: How much you owe compared to how much credit is available to you.

In case there is no nominee made under the policy, then the insurance company will insist upon a succession certificate from a court of law for disbursing the claim amount. Alternatively, the insurers can deposit the claim amount in the court for disbursement to the next legal heirs of the deceased.   

*What is the difference between Health Insurance amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Critical Illness policies or Critical Illness Riders in insurance?

The insurers refer such health issues to their medical panel to differentiate between preexisting and newly contracted illnesses.

Please contact us if you have any other questions you amp;amp;#;d like us to address. 

*What is a cash value life policy?
A cash value life policy covers you for your lifetime. amp;amp;quot;Cash value means that premiums generally stay level during the premium payment period. The policy not only provides insurance benefits when you die, but it also builds up a dollar value from your premium payments and investment returns. You can borrow against this value with a policy loan or redeem it for cash at any time before the policy matures. Whole life, universal life and extra value life are some of the more popular forms of cash value life policies. 

*What kind of life insurance should I buy?
If you have long-term needs - for example, if you require life-long protection for premature death, retirement income or cash to settle your estate - then you should consider cash value insurance. Likewise, if you need protection for a specified period of time, perhaps to pay off a loan or mortgage in the event of your death, term insurance may be the right choice for you. 

*Will my policy amp;amp;#;s premiums ever be increased?
It depends on the type of policy you purchase. Many policies have fixed premiums that cannot be increased, while other policies limit premium increases. 

*Can I increase my life insurance coverage?
Usually, you can increase your coverage with a new policy or by adding a rider to your existing policy. However, a universal life policy can be increased without a rider or new policy. All coverage increases require you to provide evidence of insurability to your insurer. 

*What are the definitions of amp;amp;quot;convertible and amp;amp;quot;renewable?
amp;amp;amp;quot; Convertible and amp;amp;quot;renewable are provisions in a term insurance policy. With a convertible policy, the policy owner has the option to exchange the policy for another insurance plan without evidence of insurability. However, term policies can only be converted to cash value policies. With a renewable policy, the policy owner can renew (or extend) the policy at the end of its term without evidence of insurability. When a policy includes both provisions, they continue until specified ages and then stop. Premium rates increase at each renewal, based on the insured amp;amp;#;s age. 

*Is term insurance the lowest-cost life insurance I can buy?
Term insurance offers the lowest premium rates. However, each time a term policy is renewed, premiums increase and continue to do so rapidly over the years. Also, term insurance does not continue over the insured amp;amp;#;s entire lifetime. Whole life, universal life and extra value life can be less costly over the long term and also provide the advantage of cash value. 

*Do life insurance policies pay dividends?
Some companies issue participating policies that pay dividends. Here amp;amp;#;s how it works: Premiums include a safety factor to cover unexpected occurrences during the year. At year end, insurers analyze actual costs and earnings, and return any surplus to policyowners in the form of dividends. 

*Must I receive my dividends in cash?
No. You can receive dividends as cash and use them to reduce your premiums, or you can let them accumulate interest. Unless your policy is a term insurance plan, you can also use dividends to purchase additional paid-up life insurance. 

*What is the best way to use my policy dividends?
It is wise to use dividends to reduce your premiums, which will minimize your cash outlay. If you purchased a policy for investment purposes, then the dividends can be left to accumulate interest. The amp;amp;quot;Paid-up Additions option enables you to get the best of both worlds: it provides for the purchase of additional life insurance on a paid-up basis and also generates additional cash value. 

*MAY I DIvidend option after my policy is issued?
You can change your dividend option at any time. 

*If I miss a premium payment, will I lose my insurance coverage?
If you pay the premium within the grace period following the due date, you will not be subject to a penalty or loss of coverage. 

*When can my policy lapse and what can I do if this happens?
Your policy can lapse or terminate when a premium is not paid by the end of the grace period, if the policy has no cash value. If the policy has adequate cash value, you can borrow against it to pay the premium and maintain your insurance. You could also use one of the policys non-forteiture options which allow you to-  surrender your policy and collect its cash value  purchase a reduced amount of paid-up cash value life insurance or  purchase the same amount of term insurance that you purchased originally and extend your coverage for a specified time period. 

*Can I have a lapsed policy put back into effect?
Yes. If you provide the insurer with evidence or insurability and pay all back-premiums plus interest. This is called and reinstatement and can occur anytime within five years from the date your policy lapses. The advantages of reinstating a lapsed policy are- () you pay the original premium rate () the cash value of the original policy will be greater than that of a newly issued policy and you may be charged a lower interest rate on loans against your policy. 

*Why must I pay interest when I borrow on my own policy?
Your policy amp;amp;#;s cash value does not belong to you until you surrender the policy and relinquish its protection. Until then, the cash value is part of the insurer amp;amp;#;s investment portfolio, which enables the insurer to fulfill obligations to policyowners. These assets are invested and earnings keep premiums low and increase dividends. Therefore, all loans including policy owner loans, must earn interest. 

*Must I make regular payments on my policy loan?
No. You can repay a policy loan as you wish and, as long as you make regular premium payments, your policy will remain in effect. If you don amp;amp;#;t repay your loan, the amount you owe will be deducted from any insurance proceeds. It is a good idea to pay your loan regularly so that the amount you owe does not exceed the policy amp;amp;#;s cash value, which would cause your policy to lapse. 

*What additional benefits can be added to my life insurance policy?
Disability Waiver of Premium provides for payment of premiums by the insurer in the event that the insured becomes disabled. The Accidental Death Benefit provides for payment of an additional benefit if the insured dies in an accident. Guaranteed Insurability provides for purchase of additional life insurance at regular rates and at specified ages, regardless of occupation or state of health. Term Agreements can provide additional protection for specified periods of time. 

*What is a settlement option?
When life insurance proceeds are paid to a living policy owner or to beneficiaries, they are paid under a settlement option. These options are:() a lump-sum cash payment; () monthly payments continuing until all proceeds and interest are paid; () lifetime income payments; or () payments of interest on proceeds remaining with the insurer under the interest option. 

*How is a settlement option chosen?
A .When life insurance proceeds are paid as a death benefit, the beneficiary may select or change a settlement option unless the policy owner has specified otherwise. When proceeds are paid during the lifetime of the insured, the policy owner may choose a settlement option. 

*May I change my beneficiaries?
Unless you designated your beneficiaries as amp;amp;quot;irrevocable, you always have the option to change your beneficiaries. Changes of irrevocable beneficiaries require the beneficiaries amp;amp;#;consent. Review your beneficiary designation periodically to remain secure about the distribution of you policy amp;amp;#;s proceeds. 

*Must my beneficiaries be related to me?
No. You can designate unrelated individuals, your estate, trusts or charitable organizations as beneficiaries. 

*What tax advantages are offered by life insurance?
Under current tax law, the yearly increase of cash value in a life insurance policy is not subject to Federal Income Tax. Taxes are paid only when the policy owner withdraws money from a policy amp;amp;#;s cash value, which exceeds total premiums paid. Generally, beneficiaries do not pay a Federal Income Tax on death benefits. When life insurance proceeds are received as monthly income under a settlement option, a portion of each monthly payment is received free of Federal Income Tax, until the cumulative non-taxable portions received equal premiums paid. Then, the entire payment is taxable. 

*Can my cash value life insurance policy also serve as a way to accumulate interest?
Yes. A cash value life insurance policy is one way to accumulate funds for retirement or other purposes. Life insurance provides coverage in the event of untimely death, while offering a systematic means of building funds. Unlike a savings account in which you make deposits whenever you wish, a cash value insurance policy requires regular premium payments on specified dates, increasing your cash value. 
*Why invest in a cash value policy when a savings account may pay a higher interest rate?
A savings account may pay a higher interest rate, but it does not offer the insurance coverage or death benefits a life insurance policy guarantees. Life insurance can serve as both an investment vehicle and a source of income in the event of death. 

*What effects will inflation have upon my policy amp;amp;#;s cash accumulation?
Inflation typically raises interest rates and, consequently, your rates of return. Like other investments, funds placed in cash value, dividend-paying insurance policies should reflect increased earning rates. 

*What is an annuity?
An annuity is a contract that provides guaranteed lifetime income to an annuitant (the person receiving the income), usually after retirement. An individual purchases an annuity either through a lump-sum payment or through regular installments. At a certain age, the annuitant receives regular payments for life. 

*What is an IRA?
An individual retirement account (IRA) is a retirement savings plan you set up for yourself. You contribute a portion of your earnings to the plan to be set aside for your retirement. If your income is within certain limits, you may take a tax deduction for all or part of this contribution. One type of IRA is the Individual Retirement Annuity. Annuity funds build up on a tax-deferred basis until they are paid out at a specified age, later in life, when you may be in a lower tax bracket. 

*How does my group life insurance policy differ from a personal life insurance policy?
Since group life is issued as a single master policy to an employer or association, as a plan participant, you have no control over the price or amount of coverage. If you leave the group, your coverage usually terminates. In some states, an individual cash value policy may be purchased to replace group coverage. However, the new policy amp;amp;#;s premium rate is based on your age at the time your group coverage terminates. This amp;amp;quot;conversion does not require evidence of insurability, and you may have a period of time to make the conversion while your group coverage remains in force. 

*As a stay-at-home mom, do I need life insurance?
Yes. If you were to die, your spouse would have pay for childcare and housekeeping services with household income. Life insurance is a wise option that lessens the financial strain on your family. 

*Do my children need life insurance?

*Will whole life help me during retirement ?

*Is credit life insurance a good buy?
A credit life insurance policy is frequently recommended in conjunction with taking out an installment loan when buying expensive appliances or a new car, or for debt consolidation. If, however, you already own enough life insurance to cover your financial needs, including debt repayment, buying credit life insurance is normally not a good idea because of its relatively high cost. 

*What are the tax considerations regarding life insurance cash values, dividends, and death benefits?
The interest build-up portion of the annual increase in the cash value of the life insurance policy is not taxed. Dividends generally are considered to be a amp;amp;quot;return of premium and are not taxable. Consult your tax adviser regarding questions about possible income, estate, and gift tax consequences that might affect any life insurance policy you own or are contemplating buying. 

*Why is there a market for life settlements?
The life settlement market exists because of the disparity between what insurers are willing to pay to buy back policies and the market price. The market price is often higher due to commercial realities i.e. face value minus premiums and price paid equals profit, where as the life companies only wish to buy back the residual value or premiums paid. Where there is opportunity to generate a profit, markets inevitably will appear. 

*Why might someone sell their policy?
There are many reasons why the insured may wish to sell their policy. For example: * The policy may no longer be needed or wanted * The Premium payments may have become unaffordable * The policy holder Owner could be considering lapsing or surrendering of the policy * There may have been a change in estate planning needs * The beneficiary for whom the policy was originally purchased is now deceased or no longer has a need for the policy * The policy holder requires funds to pay for medical expenses or for new or experimental treatments for themselves or someone close to them * The sale of the policy would allow the policy holder to maintain a desired standard of living 

*Is the Life Settlement market a risky one?
Like any other investment, life settlements carry risk. The major difference with life settlements however is generally that the risk is not if you will get your money back, but it is when. You will have bought an insurance policy which has a fixed pay out at maturity. The actual return will be governed by the amount of time you hold the policy before it matures. 

*What factors can impact the value of a policy?
Changes in the life expectancy tables, general economic conditions, including interest rates, inflation rates, government regulations, overall industry conditions, competition, political conditions, volatility in the financial markets and legislation could all impact the value of a policy or the ultimate return to an investor. LPG's buying expertise mitigates this risk. Utilizing deep experience sourcing and valuing policies, the management team has demonstrated a track record of buying policies at the appropriate price in order to maximize investor value. 

*How are Life Settlements valued?
The purchase price of any life settlement is based on several variables, including but not limited to: * The net death benefit of the policy * The life expectancy of the insured covered by the policy * The expected rate of return sought by the investor * The cost of insurance and other expenses associated with maintaining the policy 

*What should investors understand about maturity dates and the uncertainty of life expectancy?
The value of the policies in the life settlement market depends, among other things, upon the life expectancy of the insured. Life expectancies are estimates of the expected longevity or mortality of an insured and are inherently uncertain, especially in small sample sizes. There can be no assurance that any life expectancy obtained on an insured for a policy will be predictive of the future longevity or mortality of the insured. The actual maturity date of the policies may therefore be longer than projected, which would negatively impact the time and therefore the return on investment. In addition, improvements in medicine, disease treatment, pharmaceuticals and other medical and health services may enable insureds to live longer. To the extent actuarial assumptions differ from actual results, as to life expectancy or other assumptions made in the pricing or valuing of policies, an investor may over-pay for a policy. In addition, to the extent an investor obtains any policy based on the perceived life expectancy and such perception is inaccurate, distributions from the maturity of the policy may be delayed; in some cases, such delays could be significantly long. Current mortality tables are relied upon in part to forecast future cash flows in determining the prices paid to acquire policies. However, future mortality experiences may not resemble the mortality experiences of the past. It is possible for insureds with a certain life expectancy to experience a different mortality rate in the future than experienced by insureds with the same traits in the past. To address the risks inherent with life expectancy estimates, LPG uses at least two independent consultancy companies to assess the maturity dates for policies with a face value of $, and over. For policies with a face value of $, and below, the company uses one independent consultancys assessment and a telephone underwriting service. 

*What are Stranger Originated Life Insurance transactions (STOLI)?
An investor investing in policies will assume the credit risk associated with policies issued by various life insurance companies. The failure or bankruptcy of any such life insurance company or annuity company could have a material adverse impact on an investor's returns. However, the risk of bankruptcy is low and to date, we know of no death benefit that has been unpaid as a result of the bankruptcy or financial difficulties of any U.S. life insurance company. To further reduce this risk, Life Policy Group only purchases policies issued by life companies with B+ or higher ratings issued by A.M. Best, the leading rating agency for the insurance industry. 

*What risk is there of an insurance company going bankrupt?
An investor investing in policies will assume the credit risk associated with policies issued by various life insurance companies. The failure or bankruptcy of any such life insurance company or annuity company could have a material adverse impact on an investor's returns. However, the risk of bankruptcy is low and to date, we know of no death benefit that has been unpaid as a result of the bankruptcy or financial difficulties of any U.S. life insurance company. To further reduce this risk, Life Policy Group only purchases policies issued by life companies with B+ or higher ratings issued by A.M. Best, the leading rating agency for the insurance industry. 

*Can insurance companies contest payouts on policies?
Life insurance policies typically have a contestability clause, which permits the issuing life insurance company to contest its obligation to pay a death benefit based upon any material misrepresentation or omission made by the applicant or the insured on the life insurance application within, generally, the first two () years of the policy issue date. Life insurance companies may also contest policies based on a lack of insurable interest, which claim may survive the expiration of the two () year contestability period. To mitigate these risks Life Policy Group purchases policies from regulated providers which have passed the contestability period and were bought for the purpose of insuring a life and not engineered, premium financed or STOLI transactions bought for the purpose of making an investment return. In addition, legal checks on sellers and agents are completed and all policy documentation is reviewed for legal compliance. 

*Is there an age limit on some policies?
Some insurance policies terminate if the insured lives to the age of , or in some cases at age . If the insured outlives the policy, an investor owning such a policy may get nothing on that policy as the insurer is relieved of its obligation. Such a policy termination would result in a loss of investment return on the policy. As a result, LPG will always screen out such policies. 

*Will policies pay out on euthanasia, war or terrorism?
Once a US policy has passed the non-contestability period (two years) it will pay out even in the event of suicide or euthanasia. However, most policies are not covered in the event of war or terrorism. That said, as LPG purchases policies of insureds over the age of , the likelihood of them being exposed to war and risk is extremely low. 

*How does the policy buying process work?
A typical Life Settlement transaction begins with a policy owner obtaining an expected life expectancy (LE) report from an independent, third party medical underwriter. Based upon health and medical information, an evaluation can be made and life expectancy determined by an independent medical underwriting firm. Each policy is medically underwritten. Once a life expectancy report is produced and other conditions are satisfied, a policy is purchased by an institutional purchaser or trust, pursuant to a purchase agreement and other ancillary closing documents that transfers the legal ownership and beneficial interest in the policy to the purchaser. All policies offered by LPG are purchased pursuant to documentation that, among other things, ensures that the former beneficiary and spouse, where applicable, waived any future claims or rights to the policy. 

*Are the policies purchased direct from the original life?
No, the policies offered by LPG have previously been purchased from the original life assured by LPG Capital. This greatly speeds up the process of purchase. In addition Mills Potoczak and Co (MPC) acts as the servicing company for the policies in any communication with the original owners i.e. for mortality checking.   

*How can I be sure that the insured actually exists and how will I know when they die?
The policies sourced by LPG are serviced by Mills Potoczak and Co (MPC) a public accounting firm in the USA with many years expertise in providing services to the life settlement industry. MPC was founded in , and in  began providing services to the Life Settlement market. Over time MPC's services to the Life Settlement market have grown steadily and it presently services the needs of over  financial institutions worldwide. MPC has administered the acquisition of over , policies with a face value of approximately dollar ,,, and presently services over , policies with an estimated face value of approximately dollar ,,,. MPC is widely regarded as a leader within the Life Settlement industry. MPC tracks and periodically monitors the health and life status of the insured so that when a policy reaches maturity (the death of the insured), the servicing entity is aware of the development and can take action to collect the proceeds due under the relevant policy.   

*Is there risk regarding premium increases or failure to pay premiums?
If a life insurance company increases the cost of insurance charged for any policies, the premiums due for these policies may increase, causing investors to incur additional costs.   This may adversely affect the secondary market sale value of such policies.     LPG is able to mitigate this risk by purchasing a wide spread of policies from a diverse group of carriers, leveraging our buying expertise to buy policies at appropriate prices and avoiding policies that have high premium costs built in.   Separately, failure by an investor to pay premiums on the policies when due will result in termination or lapse of the policy, meaning the investor would lose any money invested to buy policies or pay premiums.   LPG mitigates this risk by augmenting its own disciplined monitoring process with the employment of a third party, Mills Potoczak and Company (MPC).  MPC is a specialist provider of trust services and administers in excess of , policies. The company has responsibility for premium servicing, policy closing, policy tracking and maturity claims.   

*What are the tax implications for the investor when the policy matures?
Policy proceeds may be subject to tax. Investors should seek independent professional advice on their individual tax and legal circumstances.   

*What are some of the other risks to consider when investing in life settlements?
Supply risk.  An inability to source insurance policies in the secondary market that meet specified criteria can create a performance drag.  To mitigate this risk, investment managers must leverage relationships with a wide range of suppliers to ensure adequate supply of small face policies.  The development of several new trading platforms and marketplaces has also increased the supply of policies. Counterparty risk.  The insurance company that issued a policy bought by the fund may default on its obligations to pay out on maturity.  One way investment managers mitigate this risk is by only buying policies backed by US insurance companies with ratings above B+ and again, remaining well diversified across a wide range of insurance companies so that no one company represents more than % of all policies in the combined portfolio. Administration risk.  Performance could be adversely impacted if premiums are not paid on time or benefits are not collected in a timely matter.  To mitigate this risk for investors, investment managers use a custodian bank and escrow agent to handle all money transfers including premium payments, and a tracking agent notifies the custodian bank when a policy's benefits are due to be paid.   

*What investment vehicles are available or popular?
Investors have a range of options that include direct investment in individual policies, custom portfolios of policies, and funds that invest in pools of life settlements. In the past, investors typically purchased individual large value policies directly. While this approach can yield attractive returns, there is an obvious lack of diversification. Even older funds typically focused on relatively small numbers of large value policies. Today, providers have developed more efficient methods for sourcing and pricing policies. This has made it possible to provide better diversification by making it viable to invest in a broad number of lower value policies (policies with face values as low as dollar ,).

*What are after market parts?

*Why do insurance companies use after market parts?

Dwellings which contain approved and properly maintained installations of burglar alarms, fire alarms, and automatic sprinklers may receive a selected credit to the base premium. Dwellings which are aged  years or less may be entitled to a sliding scale of premium credit. Policies which have no losses may be entitled to a lossfree credit. A credit will be applied to the policy's base premium when an insured has an active Massachusetts Private Passenger Automobile policy with Safety. 

*What is Renter's Insurance?
Just as the name suggests, renter's insurance is a type of insurance that protects renters. The policy pays to replace your belongings if they are damaged, destroyed or stolen under certain conditions. 

*Why Do I Need Renter's Insurance?
The simple answer: because stuff happens. Fires break out, things get stolen and plumbing fails. With a renter's insurance policy in place, you don't have to worry about how you would handle the fall out from such events because you know that you're covered. 

*What Does Renter's Insurance Cover?
Renter's insurance typically covers loss or damaged caused by: * Fire * Smoke * Theft * Vandalism * Windstorm * Hail * Lightning * Explosion * Certain Types of Water Damage (caused by plumbing failures, appliance failures, etc.) Most renter's insurance policies also include liability coverage, which will protect you if someone is injured while at your home or if you do something that causes damage to another person's property. 

*Do I Need Renter's Insurance If My Landlord has Insurance?
Yes. Your landlord's insurance policy will only cover damage to his building. It won't pay for the replacement of your belongings and it won't cover your relocations costs, should you need to move out while repairs are made. 

*I Don't have Many Valuables, Do I Still Need Renter's Insurance?
Yes. While you may not own many valuables, you probably still own quite a bit of stuff. Take a look around your home and imagine how much it would cost to replace everything you have. Could you afford to do that? If not, you need renter's insurance. Still not convinced that you own anything worth insuring? See how many of these pricey items you own: * A computer * A television * A DVD player * A stereo * An iPod * A digital camera * Jewelry * A bike 

*How Much Renter's Insurance Do I Need?
The size of your renter's insurance policy should be based on the value of your belongings. If you're just starting out and only have the bare essentials, you don't need a lot of coverage (a dollar , policy should do it). If, however, you have a house full of expensive electronics, a bigger policy makes perfect sense. Consult an insurance agent for help in determining how much insurance you need. Other things to keep in mind: * Most renter's insurance policies do not include flood or earthquake insurance. If you live in an area that is prone to such activity, you may want tack on additional coverage * If you own jewelry, antiques or other objects of extreme value, you may need to add a separate rider to your policy to have them covered for their full replacement cost * Many insurance companies charge higher premiums (or require additional coverage) if you own a large dog. 

*How Does Renter's Insurance Pay Out Claims?
I f you have actual cash value (ACV) coverage, your insurance company will pay the cost to replace your stolen/damaged/destroyed items, minus their depreciated value. If you have replacement cost coverage, your insurance company will reimburse you for the full replacement cost of the items. Expect to pay more for replacement cost coverage. 

*How Can I Save on Renter's Insurance?
You can often get a discount on your renter's insurance if the property you're renting has certain safety features in place, this includes: a monitored burglar alarm, smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, a sprinkler system and deadbolts on all exterior doors. You may also be eligible for a multiline discount if you have your auto insurance through the same company. Often this discount is enough to completely cover the cost of your renter's insurance policy. Want to save even more? Then, consider going with a higher deductible, and ask about paying your annual premium in one lump sum. You'll usually pay more to have your premium broken up into monthly payments. 

*What is a covered event?
Covered events will be described in your Certificate of Insurance or Insurance Policy, but generally refer to events such as a strike, severe weather or a terrorist event. As with any insurance policy, customers are strongly encouraged to read their Certificate of Insurance or Insurance Policy for details regarding their available coverage. 

*When can I buy coverage?
You can always purchase the insurance, however, for there to be coverage for a specific covered event listed in the policy, such as flight cancellations due to strike or inclement weather, the plan would need to have been purchased prior to the event happening or being announced. Once the event happens or is announced, it becomes foreseeable. 

*What is a foreseeable event?
Foreseeable simply means reasonably known beforehand. Once it is reasonable that people traveling to an area would know about an event, it becomes foreseeable. For example, if the airline you are flying announces that they are going on strike, the event becomes foreseeable once they make the announcement. 

*Is it possible to insure preexisting medical conditions?
Yes, CSA can accepts preexisting medical conditions for you, your traveling companions and family members.

*As part of my trip I have internal flights booked in the country I am visiting can I claim the cost of these if I cancel?
If the airline does not provide a refund on these flights when you cancel them (which they will not be required to do if their flights are operating normally) then you will be able to claim for these costs.

No. If the airspace is closed for anything less than  hours, you should be able to continue your trip when the airspace reopens.

*How does title insurance work?
A title insurance policy is a contract of indemnity and it sets forth the terms and conditions of the contract. The following information is general in nature. Care should be taken to read the actual policy. Title insurance policies are typically purchased and issued at the time a person purchases property or obtains a new mortgage loan. A buyer pays a onetime insurance premium at closing (or upon refinancing the property). The policy contains an effective date which is typically either the date that either the mortgage or the deed of conveyance was recorded in the local land records. Generally speaking a title insurance policy insures against events of record which occurred prior to the effective date of the policy. Events affecting title which occur after the time of your closing would not generally be covered, unless, of course, they were based on some defect in the title which existed prior to the effective date. There are specific exclusions from coverage of the policy, these are set forth in the policy. Normally, items discovered during the title search that encumber the property will not be insured since they are already of record. For instance, most properties have one or more easements in favor of utility companies to permit the location of gas, electric, water or sewer lines, and these will be set out as exceptions in the title insurance policy. Be certain to ask your attorney to explain these items to you in more detail and be sure that you purchase on Owner's policy to protect your investment in your property. 

*Why buy title insurance?
Title insurance provides two major benefits to policyholders, provided that coverage is triggered. First, it will pay to defend the insured's title against claims of third parties. Second, it will pay for loss or damage caused by a defect in title and suffered by the insured to the extent of the policy limits. While most defects are discovered by a title search, there are a number of hidden defects which neither the seller nor the attorney examining the title would discover, but which could affect your title. Examples of these are lost, forged or incomplete deeds; deeds executed by incompetent persons; incorrectly indexed deeds in the land records; claims of Indian tribes; some permit issues (on Expanded Protection policies). Title insurance covers such potential problems.

*When should I buy a whole life insurance policy?
Whole life insurance is the policy of choice if you're considering purchasing life insurance for long term goals.Whole life offers a builtin savings element, because it allows you to build cash value for your premiums, and can be used as part of your estate planning.You should consider buying whole life when you are looking for insurance that you'll keep for your entire life. 

*Is whole life insurance more expensive than term life insurance?
You'll pay higher premiums for whole life insurance initially, but if you're planning on keeping your life insurance throughout your life, you'll end up paying less overall for whole life insurance than you would if you keep renewing your term life policy as you age. 

*What's the difference between term and whole life insurance?
The biggest difference between term life and whole life insurance is the length of time that you're insured.Whole life insurance will provide coverage for your entire life, as long as you pay the premiums and don't surrender the policy.Term life is only meant to cover you for a fixed period that is stated in the policy.If you want to be covered for longer, then you'll have to renew your policy. 

*What are the main types of traditional whole life policies?
The main types of whole life policies are nonparticipating and participating.A nonparticipating policy has a level premium and fixed face amount for your entire life.It offers the advantage of fixed costs, so that you can budget, and relatively low premium payments.It does not pay dividends.A participating whole life policy pays dividends that result from favorable investments.Dividends can be paid in cash or used to reduce your premium payments.It can also be used to buy additional insurance to increase the face amount of the policy. Within the two broad types of insurance, there are many types of whole life plans from which to choose. 

*What's the difference between 'cash value' and the face amount of a whole life policy?
The face amount of your policy is the amount of the benefit that will be paid out to your beneficiaries in the event of your death.The cash value is the value that builds up in your policy as you pay premiums.If you surrender your policy, you'll get the cash value of your policy back.If you die while still covered, your beneficiaries will receive the face value. 

*Can I borrow against a whole life policy?
Generally, yes, the owner of the policy may borrow money against its cash value, if there is sufficient cash value in the policy to secure the loan.The exact details will be described in the policy documents. 

*Can I surrender a whole life policy for its cash value?
Again, the answer is generally yes, depending on specific circumstances.The exact amount will be determined by the current cash value less any outstanding loans or unpaid premiums. 

*Will I be paying insurance premiums for the rest of my life with a whole life policy?
Traditional whole life policies require payment of premiums throughout your life, but there are other types of whole life insurance policies that may be paid in full sooner.There are some life insurance products that can be purchased with a onetime payment, or with a fixed period of premiums to pay off the entire policy.Those policies will require higher premiums, but free your income in your later years. 


*What about taxes on dividends, loans, benefits and other income derived from insurance policies?
Because whole life insurance is considered an investment vehicle, you'll generally only pay taxes on the dividend amount that is greater than the premiums that you pay.The same holds true for cash value if you surrender your policy for cash value.A tax advisor can explain the particulars of how benefits, dividends and other income from your insurance policy is taxed. 

*What are the greatest cons of whole life policies?
The biggest cons of whole life polices are that whole life insurance is more complex and more difficult to understand, and that the premiums are higher than term life insurance. 

*What are the principal types of medical expense insurance coverage?
Medical expense insurance is broadly classified into two principal types of coverage: base (or basic) plans and major medical plans.Base plans generally consist of either hospital expense coverage, surgical expense coverage, or both.Basic hospital and surgical expense plans generally provide coverage on a firstdollar basis (i.e., no deductible) and provide  percent reimbursement of covered expenses, up to a relatively low maximum of dollar ,, dollar ,, dollar , or dollar ,.Major medical plans, in contrast, apply a deductible to initial expenses, generally ranging from dollar  to dollar  per calendar year.After the deductible is satisfied, major medical plans typically reimburse  percent of eligible expenses up to a relatively high maximum, e.g., dollar , or dollar ,,.Some major medical plans reimburse eligible expenses at  percent; some plans also provide unlimited lifetime benefits.Major medical plans typically cover a broad list of medical expenditures, including hospital expense, surgical expense, physician (nonsurgical) expense, private duty nursing, diagnostic Xray and laboratory services, prescription drug expense, artificial limbs and organs, ambulance services, and many other types of medical expenses when prescribed by a duly licensed physician.Thus, in comparison with basic plans, major medical plans provide much broader coverage, with higher limits, but these plans require the insured to share in the cost of medical care through deductibles and coinsurance (i.e.,  or  percent of eligible expenses above a deductible amount). 

*Is medical expense coverage available for substance abuse and mental illness?
Major medical expense plans also generally provide coverage for treatment of substance abuse (e.g., alcoholism and drug usage) and mental illness.A higher coinsurance percentage (e.g.,  percent) and a lower lifetime benefit limit (e.g., dollar , or dollar ,) generally applies, however.In addition, the extent of coverage may depend on whether treatment is provided on an inpatient or outpatient basis. 

*What types of expenditures are commonly excluded under major medical expense plans?
B.Although providing very broad coverage, major medical plans typically contain a number of exclusions.Common exclusions include medical expenditures arising from: () convalescent or custodial care; () physical examinations, unless required for the treatment of an injury or illness (it should be noted that some plans now cover this expenditure); () cosmetic surgery unless required to correct a condition resulting from an injury or a birth defect; () occupational injuries and illnesses that are otherwise covered under a Workers' Compensation law; and () routine dental and vision care (care required for treatment of an injury and dental and eye surgery are frequently covered, however).Other common exclusions relate to benefits provided by government agencies (e.g., VA hospitals) and expenses paid under other insurance programs, including Medicare.
