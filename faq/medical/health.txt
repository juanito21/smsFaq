*Is there any way to make wine without sulfites?
It is impossible to make sulfitefree wines, because sulfites are a natural and normal byproduct of the fermentation process. Even grapes that simply ripen and fall off the vine and ferment from naturally occurring, airborne yeasts will contain sulfites. Sulfites in wines are important both for its antioxidant and antimicrobial properties; it prevents the wine from oxidation spoilage and spoilage from microbes. 

*What if I'm allergic to sulfites?
Sulfites cause little to no problems for most people and genuine sulfite allergies are not really that common. The FDA in the US, estimates that only 1perc. of the general population and 5perc. of asthmatics are truly sensitive to sulfites. If you are genuinely allergic to sulfites, you will also have a problem with a lot of other foods: foods, such as dried fruits, bottled juices, molasses, sauerkraut, pickled onions, dried potatoes, wine vinegar, gravies and sauces, fruit toppings, corn muffins, avocado dip, and the list goes on and on. The most common side effects of a sulfite allergic reaction are a rash or tingling and swelling. The "Red wine headache" is commonly thought to be a reaction to sulfites, but instead some experts suspect that these headaches are related to the level of tannins in winered wines being much more tannic than whites. If you are truly allergic to sulfites, then wine kits are probably not for you, but then, neither are the regular commercial wines. You might want to look into organic wines and low sulfite wines as a possible solution to your problems. 

*can i add the sulfite packet to my wine?
Yes. If you do not add the sulfites to your wine, your wine will spoil quite quickly. Always add the packets as instructed on your kit instructions. 

*I added too much sulfite to my wine. Is there anything I can do?
Sulfites cannot be easily removed from wine. There is no process or chemical additive that will remove large amounts of sulfites from wine. Pouring it back an forth from one bucket to another will not do the trick. Only time will diminish the concentration of free SO2 in your wine. However, If you happen to have another identical batch of wine that is low on sulfites, the two batches can be mixed together resulting in a more Even average sulfite level in both wines. 

*Do I have to add the potassium sorbate to my wine?
Normally Yes. The potassium sorbate is necessary to prEvent refermentation and the possibility of your bottles exploding. Also, make sure that your wine is finished fermenting. A good rule of thumb is to never rack a wine until the specific gravity has reached 0.995 or less. See also Potassium Sorbate, omitting. 

*I added the yeast to my kit a couple of days ago, but nothing is happening. What can I do?
First, is the temperature of your must too cold? It should be between 2127 C (7080 F). Next, check for sure to see if anything is happening. If you recorded your specific gravity (Sg.) reading when you first started your kit, then check it now (presumably this would be a few days later) and record the reading. If the second reading is lower than the first, you can be sure that fermentation is taking place, Even though there may not be much frothing or bubbling. If you didn't record the initial Sg. reading, then record it now, then wait two days and measure again. If the latter reading is a few points lower, fermentation is taking place. If unchanged, add another packet of yeast, stir and then record your Sg. reading. Check again in two days and it should be lower. 

*What are the additives wich are added in wine , what they do in wine?
Oce fermentation is complete, potassium metabisulfite is added. With the help of high alcohol levels and the low pH, potassium metabisulfite causes the remaining, active yeast cells to go dormant. At the same time, it also acts as a preservative and as an antioxidant. After that, the potassium sorbate coats the yeast cells, prEventing the reproduction necessary to sustain fermentation. Finally the fining agents are added and that causes the yeast to drop out of suspension into the sediment at the bottom of the carboy. 

*What is Metatartaric Acid?
Metatartaric acid is added to wine kits that contain very high quality juice as these kits are likely going to have bitartrate crystal dropout (wine diamonds). Wine diamonds are totally benign and not a fault, but some people prefer to not have them in their wine. If metatartaric acid is added to the wine it will keep the crystals in suspension for 18 months or more, it is an optional step. 

*The instructions say that if I am planning on aging past 6 months I should add an extra 1/4 teaspoon of sulfite. I might keep a couple bottles that long should I add extra sulfite?
Sulfite dissipates over time as wine ages. if you are planning on long term aging of your wine before you drink it, add an extra 1/4 teaspoon of sulfite to the 23 liters (6 gallons) of wine. However, if most of it will be consumed before 6 months do not add any additional sulfite beyond what the kit normally calls for, as you will get a sulfurous flavor (like burnt matches) in your wine. 

*I understand that chitosan is a shellfish derivative. I am allergic to shellfish, am I at risk when drinking wine that has been fined with chitosan?
Even though some wine kit companies print an allergy alert on their packaged chitosan, there really is no danger to those with shellfish allergies. Chitosan is a sugar or a fiber derived from the shells of crustaceans such as, crab, shrimp, lobster, crayfish and squid. Allergic reactions do not come from the shells, but rather from proteins found in the shellfish itself. Chitosan is also used in plastic surgery to promote tissue growth, in dentistry to treat gum disease, and as a fat inhibitor in dietary supplements. 

*I accidentally switched the order of the Kieselsol and Chitosan packets. What can I do?
Actually, using fining agents to clear the wine is optional as the wine will ultimately settle out by itself. Reversing the order of the Kieselsol and Chitosan basically renders them ineffective. If the wine is left to sit in a carboy long enough it will clear anyway, but it will take much longer to clear. If left to clear longer than three months, be sure to add another 1/4 teaspoon of potassium metabisulfite to prEvent oxidation. An alternative would be to purchase additional fining agents and use them in the correct order. 

*Do I have ADD to rinse the sulfite out of my bottles before bottling?
No. The bottle should be drained on a drain tree before bottling, but the sulfite residue should remain. It only acts to protect the wine from spoilage organisms and against oxidation. 

*What are Tannins?
If you have ever bitten into a grape seed and felt your mouth dry up, that was caused by tannins. Tannins are a family of natural organic compounds which are found in grape skins, seeds, and stems. They are an important flavor component of wines, especially red wines. Red wines with little tannin should be drunk young, whereas red wines with lots of tannins should age for long times. Tannins give wine its longevity and character. 

*What are the health impacts, if any, from Stericycle?
There is uncertainty and gaps in all health research so it is impossible to declare that ANY human activity is risk free. Health assessments are based on the best information available. We have no information which indicates that Stericycle is causing any health impacts. It is operating within permit standards. Those standards were established, taking into consideration the fact that sensitive elderly, healthimpaired, and young children, could be living in the area. Also, the possible synergistic effects of chemicals were one of the safety factors used in setting regulatory and health standards. Our conclusions are based on the best current research; new information can change safety levels and the agency will respond accordingly to protect public health if that happens. 

*Why are you allowing homes and schools to be built in area?
We do not have planning and zoning authority. By state law, those decisions are made at a local government level. We have the authority to issue permits to sources that have the potential to emit pollution. We can also advise a developer or a community what is in an area. To make informed decisions, The public can see what is within an area by going to this website http://oaspub.epa.gov/enviro/ef_home2.toxics and typing in a zip code. 

*Is it safe for children to be attending the schools which are near alcohol preparing zone ?
We see no scientific evidence that the schools or adjacent residences are unsafe due to Stericycle air emissions. The dioxin report I received was not what I considered current (2003) is there anything more current? Why cannot we do more immediate and thorough tests in this exact area? The study conducted in Davis County in 2003 characterized background levels and verified that what we currently suspect about dioxin is right. The study showed no significant impacts from dioxin and also showed that the levels found in soils here were no different than what would be found in a geographically similar major metropolitan area. Dioxins are viewed as both a local and global issue. DAQ will cooperate with EPA on both local and global strategies. Background levels are the best indicators of probable human exposure. Their change is adequately monitored by studies spaced in years and decades. A further study of dioxin levels is not warranted at this time, given 2003 study plus Stericycles emission levels. Periodic stack tests confirm dioxin emissions are within regulated values. The most recent stack test was completed in midOctober. Those results are being analyzed and will be available within a few months. They will be posted on the website. 

*What are the health effects of dioxin?
To begin, let's add perspective. Within the human body, dioxin levels build up gradually over time. Diet primarily eating fatty meats is the largest contributor to dioxin exposure. Dioxins do not significantly enter the body through breathing. For there to be an impact, there has to exposure. The permitted levels of dioxins at the Stericycle plant have been purposefully set far below any level where an exposure would be expected. The actual levels for each year have been below Even the permitted levels. With that perspective, the general perspective can be answered. Scientific studies of people who have been highly exposed to dioxin show reproductive and developmental problems, increased heart disease, and increased diabetes. Dioxin's ability to cause birth defects has not been established; studies in mice have shown that dioxin and similar chemicals can produce congenital defects. Studies have also shown that dioxin exposure at high levels in chemical workers has led to an increase in cancer. 

*Does the EPA know about Hazardous Air Pollutants in the area?
Yes. Emissions from Utah facilities are regularly reported to EPA One of EPA's six national Air Toxic Monitoring sites is in Bountiful area. 

*Why hasn't there been ANY study or REvIEW of the area in general as an cumulative
effective of all airborne and ground water pollution in this South Davis Area? Why doesn't DEQ regulate the cumulative environmental impacts DEQ regulations focus on individual facilities and/or mediaspecific (air, land, water) programs. Permit parameters take into consideration cumulative effects within a given media. For example: The Air Quality program regularly monitors airsheds for criteria and hazardous air pollutants. The Water Quality program follows similar steps for facilities that discharge pollutants that ultimately end up in lakes or streams. As a Department, DEQ is participating in studies to learn more about how mercury impacts the environment and where these impacts are occurring. To assure that cumulative impacts are being addressed, permit parameters are monitored during compliance inspections and record reporting periods. Airsheds and water bodies are regularly monitored, watching for red flags. When red flags are raised, we take a closer look to see if we can find out why, and then identify what steps need to be taken with the resources we have available. Such studies are indicated when pollutant health safety thresholds are being approached in one or more ways through breathing, skin contact, swallowing, etc. The information we have on tthe South Davis Area does not suggest that a study is needed . 

*Why cannot another station be placed closer to the Foxboro development and the schools in that area?
The station in Bountiful was set up to monitor the entire airshed. It was located based on an emission inventory which looked at vehicle traffic and the location of commercial and industrial facilities. DAQ does have the option to locate a monitor to look at emissions from a specific facility. This can done if there are funds available and when there are questions about compliance status and the impact on public health. Any special purpose monitoring augments available information and is used in combination with complaint histories and source inspection information to evaluate the local impacts on a community. For the pollutants of concern at the Stericycle facility and the expected emission rates from the facility, DAQ ambient monitoring methods would not be likely to identify the contribution from such a small source. The results of local monitoring would mirror the Bountiful monitor. 

*Why (are filters) sent outofstate for results?
Labs which perform analysis are selected through a bidding process. To be selected, a lab must meet EPAestablished criteria and be the lowest bidder. Currently, an Oregon lab does most of the filter analysis. For the Urban Air Toxics Trend Monitoring Program, while Utah operates the monitor, the filters are returned to EPA for analysis. What will you do to keep us informed? The results of the stack test and other information as it becomes available will be posted on the website. 

*Why do we get headaches when we're hung over?
You probably already know that alcohol is a diuretic and, therefore, induces dehydration. Headaches, particularly migraines, are often caused by poor hydration, which occurs with hangovers after a night of heavy drinking. However, alcohol is also a vasodilator, which means it expands your blood vessels, including the ones in your brain. The increased pressure can lead to pain. Finally, different types of alcohols contain different chemicals that may affect chemical balances in the brain. Red wine and brandy have the most of these chemicals and are, therefore, more likely to cause headaches. Scotch, vodka, other "clear" spirits, and Riesling wines have the fewest. 

*Does alcohol cause ulcers?
If consumed in excess, alcohol can irritate the stomach lining that protects the tissue from digestive juices and can increase the production of stomach acids. This is called gastritis. However, it's unknown whether this alone can cause an ulcer or if it needs the H. pylori bacteria as an accomplice. So far, there is no clear, direct relationship between alcohol and ulcers. Alcohol, however, can delay the healing of an ulcer; so, avoid it during recovery. 

*Does my body weight affect how quickly I get drunk?
Here's the formula you need to remember: More fat = higher blood alcohol concentration (BAC). Why? Alcohol has a high affinity to water and will pervade all body parts that contain it. A person with a lot of body fat has a lower percentage of body water, so their BAC will be higher. However, this formula applies only to body fat. Bigger people don't necessarily have more body water than smaller ones. Therefore, a tall overweight guy will be less affected by alcohol than a short overweight guy, Even if their body fat percentage is identical. 

*Are there health benefits to alcohol?
Many studies have shown that moderate drinking brings on a whole slew of health benefits, so much so that certain governments allow alcohol makers to advertise such boons on their bottles. For example, the French chalk up their high life expectancy to a glass of wine a day. It makes sense: Moderate drinkers generally live longer, don't get sick as often, and are less stressed than heavy drinkers and abstainers. 


*Why does wine make you sleepy?
There's an old German saying that goes: "Drink wine, and you will sleep well. Sleep, and you will not sin. Avoid sin, and you will be saved. Ergo , drink wine and be saved." Every wine drinker has felt that warm, euphoric drowsiness after a few glasses. Some Even say wine is the perfect precursor to a good night's sleep. It's actually more complicated than that. Alcohol can induce sleep, but not before a brief period of stimulation. And the sleep that alcohol does bring on is a shallow "knockout" sleep that trims your normal REM phase. As a result, you can feel more tired in the morning, and it can Even aggravate sleep disorders. 

*Can you develop an allergy to alcohol?
Allergies to alcoholic beverages are uncommon, but they do occur. However, it's not the alcohol that causes allergies, but the other chemicals in the drink. Your body actually produces ethanol naturally in small doses; if it was the alcohol you were allergic to, you'd feel it constantly. Some of the substances in drinks that can trigger allergies are yeast, wheatderived substances, and certain added enzymes and preservatives. Sulfites, used to preserve wine, are known to trigger asthma attacks. Red wine also produces histamine, the main substance that induces allergic symptoms. Alcohol can also aggravate allergies, as it reduces the allergic threshold to allergens, and the vasodilation it causes can make symptoms worse. 

*Can you sweat out alcohol?
Before you start licking sweaty girls on the dance floor, know that the amount of alcohol eliminated through perspiration is almost nil; it's mostly eliminated inside your body and through urine. If you feel you sweat more when you drink, it's because alcohol stimulates your sweat glands. You're just secreting more sweat, not alcohol. However, sensitive equipment that can detect alcohol in sweat is now being used as a substitute for the Breathalyzer. 

*What are some ways to rehydrate your body after drinking?
If you replace the fluids you lose through alcoholinduced urination, you'll be fine. Just drink fluids that don't contain alcohol while you're drinking booze. Water is the best, but sports drinks like Gatorade and noncaffeinated, lowsugar soft drinks will do. 

*Do certain types of alcohol affect people differently?
Besides being allergic to certain compounds in drinks, people do not react differently to different types of alcohols. This is, of course, not considering gender, weight, the percentage of alcohol in the drink, whether the drink has other qualities (like absinthe, which causes hallucinations), and other such factors. However, some people can develop an aversion to certain drinks by sheer conditioning. A person allergic to sulfites in wine can feel sick when he tastes any alcohol because he associates the allergic reaction with the flavor. 

*Can excessive drinking really damage my liver?
Yes, as a matter of fact, excessive drinking can cause several liver related diseases. One of the most common liver related diseases caused my excessive drinking, is alcoholic hepatitis. Alcoholic hepatitis can easily be recognized by the following symptoms: Abdominal pains Abnormal yellowing of the skin and eyeballs Fever If a person continues with excessive drinking, alcoholic hepatitis can be fatal. Another common liver related disease is cirrhosis or scarring of the liver. Once again, if left untreated and excessive drinking continues, cirrhosis can be fatal. 

*Why does alcohol damage the liver?
As far as medical research is concerned, alcohol acts as a food as well as a poison. As for the liver, the liver has primary function is to remove poison and toxins. As the liver does exactly this with alcohol, it is turned into yet another poison, Eventually damaging the liver cells. In simple terms, alcohol produces toxins and the liver removes toxins. However, the toxins produced by alcohol, usually outstrips the defenses produced by the liver. 
*Can I get cancer from excessive drinking?
Yes, long term drinking and excessive alcohol and substance abuse can most certainly increase your risk of getting certain cancers. Some recorded cases of cancers due to excessive drinking, is colon cancer, throat cancer, rectum cancer, liver cancer, mouth cancer, and Even kidney cancer. Moreover, women who drink excessively can increase their chances of developing breast cancer. Developing a cancer is most certainly possible and one of the many long term effects of alcohol and substance abuse. 

*Is it possible to develop heart disease due to excessive alcohol and substance abuse?
In fact, heart related diseases are one of the most common long term effects of excessive drinking. According to a recent study, however, drinking in good moderation can also be beneficial to your heart, especially with people who are great risk to heart attacks. On the long run, excessive drinking can cause several heart related diseases such as strokes and high blood pressure. 

*Is it true that excessive drinking can cause pancreatitis?
Yes, this is very true. Long term and excessive alcohol and substance abuse can most certainly cause pancreatitis. Just like the liver, excessive drinking will cause inflammation of the pancreas. Pancreatitis can be a lifethreatening disease. Symptoms may include abdominal pains and weight loss. 

*Alcohol Poisoning Is, this a myth or is it real?
Alcohol poisoning is everything but a myth. Excessive drinking can often lead to alcohol poisoning, which causes the person to go into an unconscious state. This can Even lead to death. 
*What other health problems can alcohol and substance abuse cause?
There are several other health related issues connected to excessive drinking. However, not all of these are long term health effects of excessive drinking. Some of which you may see below, are also short term health effects of alcohol and substance abuse. Loss of brain cells Stomach ulcers Irritated stomach and bowel Sexual problems Personal problems Muscle diseases vitamin deficiency Nerve damage Epilepsy Obesity Skin problems Infertility Erectile dysfunction Bleeding in the esophagus Brain damage 

*I have Child Health Plus for my children. Can I utilize my Health Plus Membership Card to process their medication prescriptions at the pharmacy?
Yes. 

*Are braces covered under your Child Health Plus dental program?
No, this is considered an elected cosmetic procedure. 


*How many times can I change my PCP in one year?
Twice. 

*I have been receiving treatment for Parkinsons disease from my neurologist. Do I have to continue to get a referral from my primary care physician (PCP) each time I go to the specialist or is there some way I can get a blanket referral?
Yes, a blanket referral may be available from your PCP. 


*I am calling because I need some information about the managed care plan for people on Medicaid. I am HIVpositive and need to know if you have any primary care doctors who have experience with HIV/AIDS. Can you give me their names and phone numbers?
I can send you a Provider Directory, which has a listing of all the providers in our network. Listed under the provider name it will state if the provider specializes in treating HIV/AIDS. 

*How long will it take to resolve?
No more than 30 business days after the receipt of all necessary information. 

*My mother filed a grievance and got the result, but she is not satisfied with the result. It is not an emergency situation, but she wants to appeal. How long does she have to file an appeal?
Up to 60 Days. 

*What is the difference between a dental hygienist and a dental assistant?
A dental hygienist must be licensed and registered by the state in which he/she practices. Dental hygienists have a minimum of two years post high school education, must pass a written national board examination and a regional or state clinical board. Dental hygienists have delegated patient care responsibilities and provide direct patient care. In some states, dental hygienists work under general supervision and in 44 states dental hygienists are allowed to give local anesthesia. A dental assistant needs no formal training and assists the dentist under his/her direct supervision. Some dental assistants do elect to receive formal training and apply for certification from the national dental assisting certifying board. 

*What is the difference between a dental hygienist with an associate degree and one with a bachelor's degree?
Prelicensure education in dental hygiene is offered throughout the U.S. at both degree levels and both degrees result in a candidate prepared to apply for licensure. The registered dental hygienist with an associate degree is employed as a clinical dental hygienist while the dental hygienist with a bachelor's degree has a wider variety of employment opportunities. Baccalaureateeducated dental hygienists often find careers in research or marketing, education, a commission in the public health corps, federal, state and county public health positions, patient advocates, and various entrepreneurial opportunities. 
*What is the starting salary range in private dental practices in Mississippi?
Salaries vary depending the state, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics has information on earnings in the US that can be accessed through the Internet http://www.bls.gov/ 

*Does your program have summer school?
Yes. Summer school begins the day after Memorial Day each year. 

*Can I attend the have summer school program on a parttime basis?
No, students in the dental hygiene program attend fulltime. 

*Can I work while I am attending school?
The educational experience for two years at the medical center is sufficiently intense that working takes away from necessary study time. Therefore, working is discouraged. A variety of financial aid is available for dental hygiene students. This information is obtainable through the Office of Student Financial Aid once an applicant has been accepted into the program. 

*When do dental hygiene students begin providing patient care?
Dental hygiene students work with their peers as patients the fall semester of the junior year. In the spring semester of the junior year, students treat patients in the dental hygiene clinic located in the dental school. The student clinical experiences increase each semester of enrollment. 

*What is a clinical rotation?
Clinical rotations are those experiences obtained in dental facilities outside the institution's dental hygiene clinic, for example, at a veteran's hospital, a correctional facility, a public clinic, and specialty dental practices in the area 

*What causes hepatitis B?
Hepatitis B is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBv). 

*How does HBvspread?
HBvis found in the blood or certain body fluids. The virus is spread when blood or body fluid from an infected person enters the body of a person who is not infected. This can occur in a variety of ways including: . Unprotected sexual contact . Sharing drugs, needles, or "works" when using drugs . Tattooing and body piercing . Poor infection control practices in medical settings . Needle sticks or sharps exposures on the job . From mother to baby during birth . Contact with wounds or skin sores . When an infected person bites another person . Prechewing food for babies . Sharing personalcare items, such as razors or toothbrushes HBvparticles can be found on objects, Even in the absence of visible blood. The virus can remain infectious and capable of spreading infection for at least sEven days outside the human body. HBvis not spread through food or water, sharing eating utensils, hugging, kissing, coughing, and sneezing or by casual contact, such as in an office or factory setting. 


*What are the symptoms of hepatitis B?
About 7 out of 10 adults who become infected with HBvdevelop symptoms. Children under age 5 years rarely have symptoms. When people have symptoms, they usually appear between 45 and 160 days after onset of infection. People who have symptoms generally feel quite ill and might need to be hospitalized. Symptoms of hepatitis B might include the following: . Yellowing of skin and whites of eyes . Darkcolored urine . Loss of appetite or nausea . Bloated and tender belly . Extreme tiredness . Fever . Pain in joints 

*Do people fully recover?
Most people who get infected as adults will fully recover. However, about 4 of 100 people will remain infectious and carry HBvin their bodies for life. This is called chronic infection. People with chronic HBvinfection should not be excluded from work, school, play, childcare, or other settings. The majority of people with chronic HBvinfection feel healthy and do not develop serious problems related to the infection; however, about 25perc. will develop cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver failure, and liver cancer later in life. 

*How serious is infection with HBv?
Hepatitis B can be very serious. Infection with HBvcan cause lifelong (chronic) infection that can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Many people in the United States die every year from hepatitis Brelated liver disease. Fortunately, there is a vaccine to prEvent this disease. 

*How common is hepatitis B in the United States?
In 2007, 4,519 cases of acute hepatitis B were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and PrEvention (CDC); however, the actual number of new infections is estimated by the agency to be about tenfold higher. According to CDC, an estimated 0.8 to 1.4 million people have chronic HBvinfection in the United States. Since the introduction of routine vaccination against HBv, there has been a significant decline in U.S. cases among children and adolescents, the group with the largest increase in hepatitis B vaccination coverage. However, chronic HBvinfection remains a major problem. Many of the 1 million people chronically infected with HBvdo not know they are infected. Most cases of chronic HBvinfection in the United States are found in immigrants or refugees from Asia, Africa, the Pacific Islands, and Eastern Europe. People from these areas of the world should be tested to find out if they are chronically infected. Worldwide, approximately 350 million people are chronically infected with HBvand approximately 1 million of these people die each year from cirrhosis leading to liver failure or liver cancer. 

*How does a person know if s/he has HBvinfection?
Only blood tests can tell whether or not a person is currently infected and whether or not a person has been infected in the past. If the tests indicate a person has been infected in the past, testing will also determine whether the person has developed protective antibodies to the virus or whether they still have virus in their blood. 

*Is there a medication to treat hepatitis B?
There are several FDAapproved medications that might help a person who has chronic HBvinfection. These medications don't usually get rid of the virus, but they might decrease the chance of the infected person developing severe liver disease. Not every infected person is a candidate for these medications. Researchers continue to seek additional treatments for hepatitis B. There is no treatment (other than supportive care) for people with acute hepatitis B. 

*What should you do if you have been exposed to HBv?
If you think you've been exposed to HBv, contact your doctor or clinic without delay. If you have not been vaccinated, it is recommended that you receive treatment with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG), a blood product containing protective HBvantibodies. You should also get the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine as soon as possible, preferably at the same time as the HBIG is given. Following this, you will need to complete the full hepatitis B vaccine series. 

*Can you get hepatitis B more than once?
No. 

*What is smallpox?
Smallpox is an acute, contagious, and sometimes fatal disease caused by the variola virus (an orthopoxvirus), and marked by fever and a distinctive progressive skin rash. In 1980, the disease was declared eradicated following worldwide vaccination programs. However, in the aftermath of the Events of September and October, 2001, the U.S. government is taking precautions to be ready to deal with a bioterrorist attack using smallpox as a weapon. As a result of these efforts: 1) There is a detailed nationwide smallpox response plan designed to quickly vaccinate people and contain a smallpox outbreak. This plan includes the creation of smallpox health care teams that would respond to a smallpox emergency and the vaccination of members of these teams. 2) There is enough smallpox vaccine to vaccinate everyone who would need it in the Event of an emergency. 

*What are the symptoms of smallpox?
The symptoms of smallpox begin with high fever, head and body aches, and sometimes vomiting. A rash follows that spreads and progresses to raised bumps and pusfilled blisters that crust, scab, and fall off after about three weeks, leaving a pitted scar. 

*Is smallpox fatal?
The majority of patients with smallpox recover, but death may occur in up to 30perc. of cases. Many smallpox survivors have permanent scars over large areas of their body, especially their face. Some are left blind. 

*Is there any treatment for smallpox?
Smallpox can be prevented through use of the smallpox vaccine. There is no proven treatment for smallpox, but research to evaluate new antiviral agents is ongoing. Early results from laboratory studies suggest that the drug cidofovir may fight against the smallpox virus; currently, studies with animals are being done to better understand the ability of drug to treat smallpox disease (the use of cidofovir to treat smallpox or smallpox reactions should be evaluated and monitored by experts at NIH and CDC). Patients with smallpox can benefit from supportive therapy (e.g., intravenous fluids, medicine to control fever or pain) and antibiotics for any secondary bacterial infections that may occur. 

*How is smallpox spread?
Generally, direct and fairly prolonged facetoface contact is required to spread smallpox from one person to another. Smallpox also can be spread through direct contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated objects such as bedding or clothing. Indirect spread is less common. Rarely, smallpox has been spread by virus carried in the air in enclosed settings such as buildings, buses, and trains. Smallpox is not known to be transmitted by insects or animals. 

*When are cases of smallpox infectious?
A person with smallpox is sometimes contagious with onset of fever (prodrome phase), but the person becomes most contagious with the onset of rash. The infected person is contagious until the last smallpox scab falls off. 

*If people had smallpox previously and survived, are they immune from the disease?
Yes. If they had smallpox before and survived, they are immune to the disease. 

*What if I had been exposed to smallpox previously, but did not contract the disease? Am I immune from the disease?
Just because you were exposed to smallpox does not mean that you were necessarily exposed and infected. The only way that one becomes immune to the disease is by natural disease (development of rash) and by successful vaccination, although the vaccination does not provide lifelong immunity. 

*If someone is exposed to smallpox and is vaccinated within 3 days of exposure, how can this overcome the variola that may be replicating, when it takes 23 weeks to build up immunity?
The incubation period of smallpox averages 12 days. Antibodies begin to be produced following vaccination in about a week. It is likely that vaccineinduced antibodies neutralize variola virus before it can cause significant illness. Many observational studies during the eradication program showed that vaccination within 3 or 4 days of exposure could abort or significantly reduce the severity of smallpox disease, whatever the immunology may be. 

*Is the rash in generalized vaccinia, progressive vaccinia similar to the rash in smallpox?
Generalized vaccinia is a breakout of lesions that looks similar to smallpox. It is the result of the systemic spread of virus from the vaccination site. Despite the appearance of the lesions, it is usually a mild complication after someone gets the vaccine for the first time. Before the eradication of smallpox, the rash of generalized vaccinia had been confused with smallpox. Typically, the rash of generalized vaccinia will evolve and remit more quickly than that of smallpox. 

*How serious is the smallpox threat?
The deliberate release of smallpox as an epidemic disease is now regarded as a possibility, and the United States is taking precautions to deal with this possibility. Smallpox is classified as a Category A agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Category A agents are believed to pose the greatest potential threat for adverse public health impact and have a moderate to high potential for largescale dissemination. The public is generally more aware of category A agents, and broadbased public health preparedness efforts are necessary. Other Category A agents are anthrax, plague, botulism, tularemia, and viral hemorrhagic fevers. 

*How do we expect a smallpox attack to occur, if one happens?
The deliberate release of smallpox as an epidemic disease is now regarded as a possibility. We cannot say with certainty how an attack might occur, but we do know how smallpox is normally transmitted. Transmission most often occurs through persontoperson contact, more rarely through contact with materials contaminated with the smallpox virus, rarely through airborne contagion in enclosed settings. Because an attack could have such serious consequences, every effort is being made to prepare for such a possibility Even though it is unlikely to ever occur. These preparedness efforts therefore include use of the best way to prEvent smallpox: vaccination. 

*What is meningitis?
Meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. People sometimes refer to it as spinal meningitis. Meningitis is usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection. Knowing whether meningitis is caused by a virus or bacterium is important because the severity of illness and the treatment differ depending on the cause. viral meningitis is generally less severe and clears up without specific treatment. But bacterial meningitis can be quite severe and may result in brain damage, hearing loss, or learning disabilities. For bacterial meningitis, it is also important to know which type of bacteria is causing the meningitis because antibiotics can prEvent some types from spreading and infecting other people. Before the 1990s, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis. Hib vaccine is now given to all children as part of their routine immunizations. This vaccine has reduced the number of cases of Hib infection and the number of related meningitis cases. Today, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis are the leading causes of bacterial meningitis. 

*What are the signs and symptoms of meningitis?
High fever, headache, and stiff neck are common symptoms of meningitis in anyone over the age of 2 years. These symptoms can develop over several hours, or they may take 1 to 2 days. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, discomfort looking into bright lights, confusion, and sleepiness. In newborns and small infants, the classic symptoms of fever, headache, and neck stiffness may be absent or difficult to detect. Infants with meningitis may appear slow or inactive, have vomiting, be irritable, or be feeding poorly. As the disease progresses, patients of any age may have seizures. 

*How is bacterial meningitis diagnosed?
Early diagnosis and treatment are very important. If symptoms occur, the patient should see a doctor immediately. The diagnosis is usually made by growing bacteria from a sample of spinal fluid. The spinal fluid is obtained by performing a spinal tap, in which a needle is inserted into an area in the lower back where fluid in the spinal canal can be collected. Identification of the type of bacteria responsible is important for selection of correct antibiotics. 

*Can bacterial meningitis be treated?
Bacterial meningitis can be treated with a number of effective antibiotics. It is important, however, that treatment be started early in the course of the disease. Appropriate antibiotic treatment of most common types of bacterial meningitis should reduce the risk of dying from meningitis to below 15perc., although the risk is higher among the elderly. 

*Is bacterial meningitis contagious?
Yes, some forms of bacterial meningitis are contagious. The bacteria can mainly be spread from person to person through the exchange of respiratory and throat secretions. This can occur through coughing, kissing, and sneezing. Fortunately, none of the bacteria that cause meningitis are as contagious as things like the common cold or the flu. Also, the bacteria are not spread by casual contact or by simply breathing the air where a person with meningitis has been. However, sometimes the bacteria that cause meningitis have spread to other people who have had close or prolonged contact with a patient with meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis (also called meningococcal meningitis) or Hib. People in the same household or daycare center, or anyone with direct contact with a patient's oral secretions (such as a boyfriend or girlfriend) would be considered at increased risk of getting the infection. People who qualify as close contacts of a person with meningitis caused by N. meningitidis should receive antibiotics to prEvent them from getting the disease. This is known as prophylaxis. Prophylaxis for household contacts of someone with Hib disease is only recommended if there is 1 household contact younger than 48 months who has not been fully immunized against Hib or an immunocompromised child (a child with a weakened immune system) of any age is in the household. The entire household, regardless of age, should receive prophylaxis in these cases. 

*Are there vaccines against bacterial meningitis?
Yes, there are vaccines against Hib, against some serogroups of N. meningitidis and many types of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The vaccines are safe and highly effective. 

*What is viral meningitis?
Meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes ("meninges") that cover the brain and spinal cord. viral infections are the most common cause of meningitis; bacterial infections are the second most common cause. Other, rarer causes of meningitis include fungi, parasites, and noninfectious causes, including those that are related to drugs. (For more information, see What causes viral meningitis?.) Meningitis caused by viral infections is sometimes called "aseptic meningitis." 

*Is viral meningitis a serious disease?
viral ("aseptic") meningitis is serious but rarely fatal in people with normal immune systems. Usually, the symptoms last from 7 to 10 days and the patient recovers completely. Bacterial meningitis, on the other hand, can be very serious and result in disability or death if not treated promptly. Often, the symptoms of viral meningitis and bacterial meningitis are the same. For this reason, if you think you or your child has meningitis, see your doctor as soon as possible. 

*What causes viral meningitis?
Different viral infections can lead to viral meningitis. But most cases in the United States, particularly during the summer and fall months, are caused by enteroviruses (which include enteroviruses, coxsackieviruses, and echoviruses). Most people who are infected with enteroviruses either have no symptoms or only get a cold, rash, or mouth sores with lowgrade fever. And, only a small number of people with enterovirus infections develop meningitis. Other viral infections that can lead to meningitis include mumps, herpesvirus (such as EpsteinBarr virus, herpes simplex viruses, and varicellazoster virus the cause of chickenpox and shingles), measles, and influenza. Arboviruses, which mosquitoes and other insects spread, can also cause infections that can lead to viral meningitis. And lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, which is spread by rodents, is a rare cause of viral meningitis. 

*What are the signs and symptoms of viral meningitis?
Symptoms can appear quickly or they can also take several days to appear, usually after a cold or runny nose, diarrhea, vomiting, or other signs of infection show up. Symptoms in adults may differ from those in children: . Common in infants o Fever o Irritability o Poor eating o Hard to awaken . Common in older children and adults o High fever o Severe headache o Stiff neck o Sensitivity to bright light o Sleepiness or trouble waking up o Nausea, vomiting o Lack of appetite 


*How is viral meningitis diagnosed?
viral meningitis is usually diagnosed by laboratory tests of a patients spinal fluid (from a "spinal tap"). The test can reveal whether the patient is infected with a virus or a bacterium. The exact cause of viral meningitis can sometimes be found through tests that show which virus has infected a patient; however, identifying the exact virus causing meningitis may be difficult. Because the symptoms of viral meningitis are similar to those of bacterial meningitis, which is usually more severe and can be fatal, it is important for people suspected of having meningitis to seek medical care and have their spinal fluid tested. A hospital stay may be necessary in more severe cases or for people with weak immune systems. 

*How is viral meningitis treated?
There is no specific treatment for viral meningitis. Most patients completely recover on their own within 2 weeks. Antibiotics do not help viral infections, so they are not useful in the treatment of viral meningitis. Doctors often will recommend bed rest, plenty of fluids, and medicine to relieve fever and headache. A hospital stay may be necessary in more severe cases or for people with weak immune systems. 

*How is the virus spread?
Different viruses that cause viral meningitis are spread in different ways. Enteroviruses, the most common cause of viral meningitis, are most often spread through direct contact with an infected person 's stool. The virus is spread through this route mainly among small children who are not yet toilet trained. It can also be spread this way to adults changing the diapers of an infected infant. Enteroviruses and other viruses (such as mumps and varicellazoster virus) can also be spread through direct or indirect contact with respiratory secretions (saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of an infected person. This usually happens through kissing or shaking hands with an infected person or by touching something they have handled and then rubbing your own nose or mouth. The viruses can also stay on surfaces for days and can be transferred from objects. viruses also can spread directly when infected people cough or sneeze and send droplets containing the virus into the air we breathe. The time from when a person is infected until they develop symptoms (incubation period) is usually between 3 and 7 days for enteroviruses. An infected person is usually contagious from the time they develop symptoms until the symptoms go away. Young children and people with low immune systems may spread the infection Even after symptoms have resolved. 

*Can I get viral meningitis if I'm around someone who has it?
If you are around someone with viral meningitis, you may be at risk of becoming infected with the virus that made them sick. But you have only a small chance of developing meningitis as a complication of the illness. 
*How can I reduce my chances of becoming infected with viruses that can lead to viral meningitis?
viral meningitis most commonly results from infection with enteroviruses. But there are other causes, such as measles, mumps, and chickenpox. viral meningitis can also be caused by viruses that are spread by mosquitoes and other insects that bite people. The specific measures for preventing or reducing your risk for viral meningitis depend on the cause. . Following good hygiene practices can reduce the spread of viruses, such as enteroviruses, herpesviruses, and measles and mumps viruses. PrEventing the spread of virus can be difficult, especially since sometimes people are infected with a virus (like an enterovirus) but do not appear sick. In such cases, infected people can still spread the virus to others. Thus, it is important to always practice good hygiene to help reduce your chances of becoming infected with a virus or of passing one on to someone else: o Wash your hands thoroughly and often (see CDC 's Clean Hands Save Lives! web site). This is especially important after changing diapers, using the toilet, or coughing or blowing your nose in a tissue. For more information on hand washing, see the video Put Your Hands Together, listen to the podcast Put Your Hands Together. o Cleaning contaminated surfaces, such as handles and doorknobs or the Tvremote control, with soap and water and then disinfecting them with a dilute solution of chlorinecontaining bleach also may decrease the spread of viruses. This solution can be made by mixing 1/4 cup of bleach with 1 gallon (16 cups) of water. (See more about cleaning and disinfecting in general in CDC's PrEvention Resources). o Cover your cough. The viruses that cause viral meningitis can be spread by direct and indirect contact with respiratory secretions, so it is important to cover your cough with a tissue or, if you do not have a tissue, to cough into your upper arm. After using a tissue, place it in the trash and wash your hands. o Avoid kissing or sharing a drinking glass, eating utensil, lipstick, or other such items with sick people or with others when you are sick. . Receiving vaccinations included in the childhood vaccination schedule can protect children against some diseases that can lead to viral meningitis. These include vaccines against measles and mumps (the MMR vaccine) and chickenpox (the varicellazoster vaccine). . Avoiding bites from mosquitoes and other insects that carry diseases that can infect humans may help reduce your risk for viral meningitis (see West Nile virus, Fight the Bite!). 

*What are mitochondria?
Mitochondria (plural for mitochondrion) are sometimes described as cellular "power plants " because among other things, mitochondria are responsible for creating more than 90perc. of the energy needed by the body to sustain life and support growth. In addition to making energy, mitochondria are also deeply involved in a variety of other activities, such as making steroid hormones and manufacturing the building blocks of dna. 

*What is a mitochondrial disease?
Mitochondrial diseases result when your body's mitochondria fail to function properly. Your body's organ systems are severely affected when your mitochondria can't provide the energy needed to keep them running. Some parts of the body that require the most energy to function are: the brain, heart, liver, skeletal muscles, kidneys, endocrine and respiratory systems. 
*What are some symptoms of a mitochondrial disease?
Given the fact that mitochondria are responsible for fueling nearly all of the body's energy needs, there is a long list of symptoms depending on which organ or tissue is having the "energy crisis ". When symptoms arise from three or more organ systems a mitochondrial disease should definitely be considered. . poor growth (failure to thrive) . muscle weakness, poor coordination . sensory (vision, hearing) problems . reduced mental functions . disease of the organ (heart, liver) . dementia . respiratory problems . hypoglycemia . apnea . lactic acidosis . seizures . gastrointestinal disorders and swallowing difficulties . developmental delays . movement disorders (dystonia, muscle spasms, tremors, chorea) . stroke . diabetes . brain atrophy 
*How common are mitochondrial diseases?
It is now said that mitochondrial diseases are nearly as common as childhood cancer. One in 4,000 children born in the United States every year will develop a mitochondrial disorder by age 10. In adults, many diseases of aging have been found to have defects of mitochondrial function. These include, but are not limited to, type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease, atherosclerotic heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. In addition, many medicines can injure the mitochondria. 

*When do doctors suspect that a person may have a mitochondrial disorder?
Different symptoms indicative of mitochondrial diseases may present over time. As patients begin to present with multiple catastrophic symptoms it can be hard for physicians to pinpoint the main cause. It is crucial that they never remove or set aside a symptom to try and diagnose the problem. All symptoms must be given consideration. Mitochondrial disease should be suspected when: . A common disease has a typical features that set it apart from the pack . Three or more organ systems are involved . Recurrent setbacks or flare ups in a chronic disease occur with infections 

*Is there a cure for mitochondrial diseases?
There is not a cure for mitochondrial diseases. Doctors must look at each patient on a casebycase basis and try to develop a treatment plan. Treatment may involve special diets and/or a combination of vitamins, and reducing any stress on the body. 

*How is a mitochondrial disease inherited?
The types of mitochondrial disease inheritance include, . Nuclear dna (dna contained in the nucleus of the cell) inheritance. Also called autosomal inheritance. . If this gene trait is recessive (one gene from each parent), often no other family members appear to be affected. There is a 25 percent chance of the trait occurring in other siblings. . If this gene trait is dominant (a gene from either parent), the disease often occurs in other family members. There is a 50 percent chance of the trait occurring in other siblings. . Mtdna (dna contained in the mitochondria) inheritance. . There is a 100 percent chance of the trait occurring in other siblings, since all mitochondria are inherited from the mother, although symptoms might be either more or less severe. . Combination of mtdna and ndna defects, . Relationship between ndna and mtdna and their correlation in mitochondrial formation is unknown . Random occurrences .Diseases specifically from deletions of large parts of the mitochondrial dna molecule are usually sporadic without affecting other family members disease . 

*What is Alpers?
Alpers' Syndrome is a disease of the brain and liver. There are 3 classical symptoms of Alpers' Syndrome. These are, 1) seizures that are very difficult to treat and have a focal component, 2) episodic psychomotor regression or dementia (loss of developmental milestones, often associated with common childhood infections), 3) liver disease. The children are born and develop normally for a period of time in virtually every case. Symptoms begin between the first few weeks of life and about 25 years of age. Twothirds of the cases begin to show symptoms of seizures, or episodic loss of developmental milestones, within the first 2 years of life. The liver disease is often subclinical in the early stages of disease, but can appear at any time as acute liver failure. Alpers' Syndrome is a recessive genetic disease with a frequency of about 1,250,000 live births. Many cases die before an accurate diagnosis is made, so the true frequency is still an estimate. Alpers is caused by inheriting two copies of the POLG gene that are dysfunctional. These are called mutant copies. The function of the POLG gene is to copy mitochondrial DN. In Alpers' Syndrome, POLG is defective, so after a period of time, the amount of mitochondrial dna in the cell falls below a critical threshold of about 35 perc. of normal. When this happens, the mitochondria become sick, and begin to misfire. This leads to the brain and liver disease of classical Alpers' Syndrome. 

*Are These High levels of Antioxidants and Zinc Right for You?
The AgeRelated Eye Disease Study (AREDS) sponsored by the Federal government's National Eye Institute has found that taking high levels of antioxidants and zinc can reduce the risk of developing advanced agerelated macular degeneration (AMD) by about 25 percent. This major clinical trial closely followed about 3,600 participants with varying stages of AMD. The results showed that the AREDS formulation, while not a cure for AMD, may play a key role in helping people at high risk for developing advanced AMD keep their remaining vision. But is the AREDS formulation right for you? Here are some questions and answers that can help you make that decision 

*Who Should Take the AREDS Formulation?
People who are at high risk for developing advanced AMD should consider taking the combination of nutrients used in the study. Your eye care professional can tell you if you have AMD and are at risk for developing the advanced form of the disease. The doctor should give you a dilated eye exam in which drops are placed in your eyes. This allows for a careful examination of the inside of the eye to look for signs of AMD. Before taking these high levels of vitamins and minerals, you should talk with your doctor about the risk of developing advanced AMD and whether taking the AREDS formulation is right for you. 

*What is the Dosage of the AREDS Formulation?
The specific daily amounts of antioxidants and zinc used by the study researchers were 500 milligrams of vitamin C; 400 International Units of vitamin E; 15 milligrams of betacarotene (often labeled as equivalent to 25,000 International Units of vitamin A); 80 milligrams of zinc as zinc oxide; and two milligrams of copper as cupric oxide. Copper was added to the AREDS formulations containing zinc to prEvent copper deficiency anemia, a condition associated with high levels of zinc intake. 

*Can I Take a Daily Multivitamin if I Am Taking the AREDS Formulation?
Yes. A daily multivitamin contains many important nutrients not found in the AREDS formulation. For example, elderly people with osteoporosis need to be particularly concerned about taking vitamin D, which is not in the AREDS formulation. The AREDS formulation is not a substitute for a multivitamin. In the AgeRelated Eye Disease Study, twothirds of the study participants took multivitamins along with the AREDS formulation. If you are already taking daily multivitamins and your doctor suggests you take the AREDS formulation, be sure to review all your vitamins with your doctor before you begin. 

*Can a Daily Multivitamin Alone Provide the Same High levels of Antioxidants and Zinc as the AREDS Formulation?
No The AREDS formulation's levels of antioxidants and zinc are considerably higher than the amounts in any daily multivitamin. 

*Can Diet Alone Provide the Same High levels of Antioxidants and Zinc as the AREDS Formulation?
No. The high levels of vitamins and minerals are difficult to achieve from diet alone. However, previous studies have suggested that people who have diets rich in green, leafy vegetables have a lower risk of developing AMD. 

*Will Taking the AREDS Formulation PrEvent a Person from Developing AMD?
No. There is no known treatment that can prEvent the development of AMD. The study did not show that the AREDS formulation prEvented people from developing early signs of AMD. No recommendation has been made for taking the AREDS formulation to prEvent early AMD. Taking the formulation reduced the rate of advanced AMD in people at high risk by about 25 percent over a 6year period. We do not know if this treatment effect will persist over a longer period. However, by continuing to follow the AREDS participants, we hope to find out if the treatment effect will last longer than six years. 

*Where Can I Buy the AREDS Formulation?
You can purchase the AREDS formulation at drug stores, supermarkets, health food stores, and other retail outlets that sell pharmaceutical products. The vitamins and minerals can also be purchased separately; be certain to include copper whenever taking high levels of zinc. Taking betacarotene is not recommended for smokers. 

*Are There Any Side Effects from the AREDS Formulation?
Some AREDS participants reported minor side effects from the treatments. About 7.5 percent of participants assigned to the zinc treatments compared with five percent who did not have zinc in their assigned treatment had urinary tract problems that required hospitalization. Yellowing of the skin, a wellknown side effect of large doses of betacarotene, was reported slightly more often by participants taking antioxidants. 

*Are Former Smokers at an Increased Risk for Developing Lung Cancer if They Take High Doses of BetaCarotene?
Large clinical trials sponsored by the National Cancer Institute demonstrated that betacarotene increases the risk of lung cancer in current smokers. In these trials, most of these smokers were heavy smokers. The only other large clinical trial evaluating betacarotene was the Physicians Health Study (PHS). In the PHS, there was no evidence of increased cancer risk in those randomly assigned to betacarotene, but few physicians were active smokers. There also was no evidence of an increased risk of lung cancer in former smokers. However, many studies suggest that former smokers maintain some increased risk of lung cancer for years after stopping smoking. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that betacarotene may also slightly increase their risk of cancer, at least for a period of several years. In deciding whether to include betacarotene in a formulation designed to slow the development of advanced AMD, you and your doctor should balance the apparent increase in the risk of lung cancer associated with betacarotene with the risk of AMD progression. 

*What About Other Antioxidants Such as Bilberry and Lutein?
The AREDS did not study bilberry, lutein, or other antioxidants, so we don't know how they may affect eye disease. Future clinical trials may Eventually provide answers about these or other antioxidants. 

*Should Young People with Inherited Macular Degeneration Take the AREDS Formulation?
The AREDS only studied agerelated macular degeneration. We have no recommendations for younger people with the inherited (juvenile) forms of macular degeneration. 

*What should I know about smallpox?
Smallpox is an acute, contagious, and sometimes fatal disease caused by the variola virus (an orthopoxvirus), and marked by fever and a distinctive progressive skin rash. In 1980, the disease was declared eradicated following worldwide vaccination programs. However, in the aftermath of the Events of September and October, 2001, the U.S. government is taking precautions to be ready to deal with a bioterrorist attack using smallpox as a weapon. As a result of these efforts: 1) There is a detailed nationwide smallpox response plan designed to quickly vaccinate people and contain a smallpox outbreak. This plan includes the creation of smallpox health care teams that would respond to a smallpox emergency and the vaccination of members of these teams. 2) There is enough smallpox vaccine to vaccinate everyone who would need it in the Event of an emergency. 

*Can I get viral meningitis if I 'm around someone who has it?
If you are around someone with viral meningitis, you may be at risk of becoming infected with the virus that made them sick. But you have only a small chance of developing meningitis as a complication of the illness. 

*WHAT ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF Infectious Disease Types?
Infectious Disease Types The list of common infectious diseases is vast. Infectious diseases can be classified depending upon the micro organism responsible for causing this infection. Usually the microorganisms involved in causing these infectious diseases are the viruses, bacteria, fungus and the parasites. Although these micro organisms are present everywhere, when their presence in our body increases beyond a normal range, the person starts showing symptoms of that particular infection. Eating contaminated food or drinking impure water are some of the most common causes of infectious diseases. Also, people with a weakened immune system easily fall prey to any type of infection. Some of the common infectious diseases are given below: Hepatitis Books on types of infectious diseases have classified hepatitis as a viral infection. Hepatitis refers to a condition in which the liver gets inflamed. Skin discoloration (yellow) and dark urine are some of the most common symptoms of hepatitis. Treating hepatitis at the earliest is necessary. This is because, if hepatitis B or C left untreated can cause irreversible liver damage. Pneumonia Pneumonia is nothing but the infection of the lungs. The disease is typically marked by inflammation of the lungs and is often the result of bacterial or viral infection. People who have contracted this infection often complain about breathing problems and chest pain. Blood tests and chest X rays are the diagnostic tools used to confirm the presence of pneumonia. In rare cases, seasonal flu or common cold aggravate and cause pneumonia. Tuberculosis (TB) This is yet another infectious disease that is typically marked by frequent episodes of coughing. Tuberculosis is basically a bacterial infection of the lungs and symptoms are usually noticed when the disease reaches the advanced stage. Being an airborne infection, it can affect anyone, irrespective of age. As the disease progresses, cough worsens and produces blood. This bad cough usually persists for more than 3 weeks and causes chest pain. Oral Thrush In the list of types of infectious diseases, oral thrush is classified as a fungal infection. This condition is the result of overgrowth of fungus in the lining of the mouth. Oral thrush triggers an uncomfortable feeling inside the mouth. This happens because white lesions develop on the tongue and in severe cases these open wounds are also seen on the gums and the tonsils. Oral thrush is frequently diagnosed in infants but in most cases, it is a minor issue. However, to reduce the pain around the mouth the doctor may prescribe some anti fungal infections. Malaria Research papers on types of infectious diseases classify malaria as a parasitic infection. The parasite enters our body through mosquito bites. In other words, the mode of transmission is contact with the mosquito. A person affected with malaria typically experiences high fever and excessive sweating. Dengue Fever The list of 'types of infectious diseases' is incomplete without mentioning about dengue fever. This is a viral infection caused by mosquito bites. The mosquito Aedes aegypti acts as the virus carrier and when it bites, the virus gets transmitted into the body. The viral infection causes a sudden increase in body temperature that usually ranges between 104 105 degree Fahrenheit. Other than high fever, the patient may also show red rash on many areas of the skin. Cholera Cholera is categorized as a bacterial infectious disease that affects intestines. In this condition, the bacterium resides in the small intestine and secretes a toxin. This Eventually causes diarrhea and abdominal pain. Drinking contaminated water or eating unhygienic food is the main culprit behind cholera. Watery diarrhea caused due to cholera can make the person dehydrated. So taking fluids from time to time is necessary to prEvent dehydration. 

*Identifying the infection is necessary before giving any medications?
A bacterial infection is usually treated with antibiotics where as people suffering from fungal infections are given anti fungal medicines. In case of parasitic infections like malaria, antimalarial medications are commonly prescribed to reduce the severity of symptoms. 

*WHAT ARE MAJOR CAUSE OF DEATH?
Diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and other parasites are major causes of death, disability, and social and economic disruption for millions of people. Despite the existence of safe and effective interventions, many people lack access to needed prEventive and treatment care. The lost productivity, missed educational opportunities and high health care costs caused by infectious diseases directly impact families and communities. 

*What is dna profiling?
dna profiling is a process which begins when a minute sample of genetic material dna (deoxyribonucleic acid) is taken from human tissue and ends when the sample is given a computerized numeric value in the form of a 'bar code'. Comparing a person's dna profile with a dna sample retrieved from the scene of a crime can eliminate innocent people, but can also provide a strong indication of guilt. 

*What are the benefits of dna profiling?
The experience acquired by countries already using dna profiling in their crime investigations shows that there are several important advantages to be gained: . rapid and absolute elimination of innocent suspects; . rapid identification of offenders with a very high degree of certainty; . reliability of evidence produced in court; . better administration of justice; . increased public confidence in the criminal justice system; . a deterrent effect on offenders with a concomitant decrease in crime; . costeffectiveness in terms of investigation time saved. 

*What are the principles of dna profiling?
The principle on which dna profiling is based is relatively straightforward: a series of molecular biology techniques is used to determine the sizes of discrete dna fragments that contain hypervariable target sequences. Because molecular biology is a new discipline with technical possibilities that are still expanding, it is hardly surprising that a variety of 'standard' techniques are used at each step in dna profiling. The analysis principles, however, remain constant. They include: . collecting samples from the scene of a crime and from victims and suspects; . extracting and purifying dna from all the samples; . cutting the dna into fragments (with a 'restriction enzyme'); . visualizing the fragments; . analyzing the resulting bank patterns by computer. dna profiling is a complicated process. As already mentioned, each sequential step involved in generating a dna profile can be carried out in a variety of ways. Although they are all straightforward, and factors affecting them have been Do cumented, each step is performed differently in different laboratories. Much of this variation is of little account, but in the present unregulated climate there remains a very real potential for generating a variety of anomalies. 

*Are there any probable defence challenges to dna profiling?
Yes, the investigating officers and prosecutors using dna profiling should be awswer. 
*Are of several areas where the defence could challenge evidence successfully.
The main points that could be raised are: . possible contamination of samples which could lead to a different interpretation of results or their invalidation; . comparison with an inadequate population sample size as the basis for the probability calculations; . improper sample handling or the unreliability of laboratory procedures. 

*Are there any efforts towards the standardisation and internationalisation of dna profiling worldwide?
Yes, it is essential that standards be established and rules on accreditation and auditing applied at both national and international levels. Only if there is one will there be a possibility to exchange data internationally. Europe seems to be a very active region from this point of view. The European dna Profiling Group (EdnaP) was set up in 1988 and it has made considerable progress. The aim of this informal group is to facilitate the exchange of compatible dna profiling data in order to allow European countries to make the best possible use of the opportunities provided by this technique. The European cooperation in this topic was reinforced and formalized by the involvement of the European Union (EU). Within this framework, there is a Working group on Police Cooperation, which deals also with dna related topics. The society of forensic scientists is represented by the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI) Working Group on dna Profiling. 

*Is INTERPOL also involved in these activities?
Yes, of course. The 25th Regional Conference (Warsaw, 2931 May 1996) enDo rsed the revised European Business Plan, in which promoting good practice in the use of dna profiling as an investigative technique is one of the main priorities. In order to implement this task, the INTERPOL European Committee decided at its 15th Meeting on 5 November 1996 to set up the INTERPOL European Working Party on dna profiling. The Final Report of the Interpol European Working Party on dna profiling (new name now: dna MEG) has been discussed by the 67th General Assembly Session in Cairo. The working group was advised to profit from the experience of other countries in the field ofdna use in criminal investigations in order to get a global harmonisation. In this respect it was agreed to invite representatives from all continents to join the dna MEG. 

*What is the INTERPOL dna profile Monitoring Expert Group (dna MEG) about and what are its tasks?
The INTERPOL dna MEG discusses the use of dna profiling as an investigative technique and will make recommendations concerning the use of dna in criminal investigations with a view to facilitating the worldwide use of this technique. The objective of the group is to act as an international point of reference facilitating the utilisation future development of dna techniques. The recommendations will address following areas: . Investigation of crimes and incidents . Establishing protocols for the application of dna . Data basing . Facilitate training Other tasks are . Providing assistance and support to developing countries acting as a catalyst for the expansion of dna applications . Widening cooperation with law enforcement agencies, international leading societies and institutions dealing with or working on dna profiling . Getting a global overview about the trends in the sphere of dna profiling . Organization of dna related conferences and working meetings 

*What is a haplogroup?
A haplogroup is defined as all the male descendants of the single person who first showed a particular mutation, called a SNP. These special mutations are extremely rare, and identify a group of people over a period of tens of thousands of years. Your haplogroup assignment indicates which part of the phylogenetic tree of male Homo Sapiens you descend from. 

*Why Do haplogroups change?
The haplogroup network is still evolving as the world's anthropologists discover more SNP mutations, which define more haplogroup branches and help us to understand how the haplogroups are interrelated. Haplogroups are named based on how they fit within the haplogroup tree. As we learn more about how haplogroups are connected, and discover more SNPs, haplogroup names will be adjusted accordingly. 

*my test result was wrong or inconclusive?
No. The results of your Ydna test are definite and are not subject to change. If you have had additional testing to determine your haplogroup, your SNP test results likewise are definite and are not subject to change. The only thing that has changed is the name of the haplogroup to which you belong, which changes as our understanding of the family tree of mankind grows. 

*Why is my haplogroup with the Genographic Project different from the one with Family Tree dna?
Recently, researchers led by Dr. Hammer, Family Tree dna's Chief Scientist, published the newly updated Y chromosome haplogroup tree in Genome Research. This paper recommends a number of changes in haplogroup nomenclature. Some organizations will adjust to this nomenclature sooner than others, as this may represent significant changes in their database, website, and display to customers. As of October, 2008, Family Tree dna has adjusted its haplogroup names to match the newer nomenclature recommended by this research. The Genographic Project will make a similar transition in late 2008. You may view the older and newer YChromosome Phylogenetic Trees at the links below. 

*How do you determine the size and quantity of a dna sample with these dna ladders or dna markers?
Load a few microliters of the dna sample together with a few microliters of a chosen dna ladder on a gel containing dna dye such as ethidium bromide. Run the gel with a DC power supplier. The dna fragments in the dna sample and in the dna ladder will be separated on the gel based on their sizes. Smaller dna fragments migrate farther than the larger ones. dna fragments will be visible as dna bands under Uvlight with ethidium bromide. Compare the relative migrated position of the dna fragment of the dna sample to the relative position of the dna fragments of the dna ladder to determine the size of the dna fragment of the dna sample. For example, if the testing dna fragment migrates to the same position as the 1 kb dna band of the dna ladder, the testing dna fragment is 1 kb. Compare the relative staining intensity of the dna fragment of the dna sample to the relative staining intensities of the dna fragments of the dna ladder to determine the quantity of the dna fragment of the dna sample. For example, if the testing dna fragment has the same staining intensity as that of the 1 kb dna band of the dna ladder at 5 ul loading, the testing dna fragment is 50 ng. A dna sample may contain multiple dna fragments. Many dna samples may be run on one gel. We normally load different volumes (e.g. 10 microl and 2 microl) of a dna ladder in the first and last lanes of a gel to orient the gel and to increase the quantity range. With these loadings, the quantity range can be increased from 20 times to 100 times with our dna ladders. 

*How much of each dna ladder or dna marker should be loaded on an agarose gel?
The recommended loading volume for these dna ladder/dna markers is 5 micro l. However, other volumes may be loaded depending on gel size and quantity of dna sample to be determined. For large gels with big loading wells, 10 to 20 micro l may be loaded. For mini gels with small wells, 1 to 2 microl may be loaded. Most agarose gel can detect 1 ng dna band (Molecular Cloning, Sambrook et al). Compare the relative migrated position of the dna fragment of the dna sample to the relative position of the dna fragments of the dna ladder to determine the size of the dna fragment of the dna sample. For example, if the testing dna fragment migrates to the same position as the 1 kb dna band of the dna ladder, the testing dna fragment is 1 kb. 

*Can we use a density scanner to determine quantity with these dna ladders?
Yes, Make sure the gel is Evenly stained when you compare different dna bands on the gel. If the gel is not Evenly stained or if ethidium bromide is running off the bottom of the gel, the quantity will not be accurate. Our standards may be used to calibrate a density scanner. 

*why are low or high molecular weight (MW) dna bands of these dna ladders or markers sometimes not resolved or detected?
the figures of these dna ladders or markers are prepared on large gels. When smaller gels are used, only low percentage gels and high percentage gels will separate and detect high MW bands and low MW bands respectively. 50 and 100 bp bands may not be visible when 1 ul or 2 ul is loaded because of small dna fragment diffusion during electrophoresis. 

*Can we label the dna fragments of the dna ladders?
yes, Each dna fragment of these dna ladders has 4 nucleotide 5' overhangs at both ends. These 5' overhangs may be labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase with ?32PATP. They may also be labeled by a Klenow fragment with ?32PdATP since all overhangs may be filled in with dATP plus dTTP, dCTP and dGTP. 

*Why Do we need to know the quantity of a dna sample
Knowing the quantity of a dna sample is important for many biochemical studies. dna fragments generated from PCR or plasmids will be used in other biochemical analysis. Their quantities can facilitate these studies. In dna sequencing, quantities larger or smaller than the required amounts will result in shorter sequence reading. In dna cloning or subcloning, incorrect amounts of vector and insert dna will lead to less efficient cloning. 

*Why are your DNA testing prices lower than others?
We are able to offer competitive pricing for all of our DNA tests as we have entered into agreements with our laboratory partner to Do bulk DNA testing. Thus we are able to pass the saving on to our clients. 

*How soon will I get my test results?
Once your samples are received by the laboratory, your results for most DNA tests will be ready within 5 working days. If you select the express option your Paternity Test results will be available within 48 hours of the lab receiving your samples. Discreet samples such as hair, chewing gum, cigarette butts etc can take a little longer but normally results will be available within the 5 7 day timeframe. 

*How Does a Paternity Test work?
Genetic testing identifies the unique genetic profile of an individual. The genetic profile of a child is inherited partly from the father and partly from the mother. By comparing the child's genetic profile with that of the alleged father, a DNA Paternity Test determines whether this person is the real biological father or can be excluded. The test is performed through our DNA Testing Kit we supply on order and the samples are taken according to the DNA Sample Collection Guide provided in the kit and on our website. 


*How accurate is the Paternity Test?
our Paternity Test is extremely powerful in answering questions of parentage. Since we use 16 different genetic markers to build the genetic profile, our test is 100 times more accurate than that required in Court. The results guarantee minimum probabilities in excess of 99.99perc. 

*Can my DNA test be used in court?
The paternity test can be used in Court only if you purchase the Legal or Court Admissable Test. This kind of test requires additional proof of identity and needs to follow a strict chain of custody process including third party sample collection and verification. The PeaceofMind/Curiosity Paternity Test is not legally admissable since the sampling process Does not follow these procedures. This test is therefore valid for informative purposes only. 

*What is the Chain of Custody procedure?
"Chain of custody" refers to the proper management or control of the DNA samples throughout the testing process. First, it requires a neutral third party to verify the identity of the individuals being tested and collect their DNA samples. Following that, the DNA samples and appropriate paperwork (including signed copies of identification papers) need to be delivered to the testing location ensuring that they have not been tampered with. Finally, the DNA laboratory performing the test needs to ensure they handle the DNA samples and paperwork correctly by tracking and Do cumenting the DNA samples throughout all of the testing process. If the procedures are followed correctly, this will allow the laboratory to issue notarized test results that can be stand up in court. In contrast, in the athome or curiosity DNA tests, the samples are taken by the clients themselves and therefore there is no independent verification of the DNA samples. Hence the laboratory is not able to confirm the identity of the individuals Do ing the test. 

*How can I interpret the result?
In our Understanding your DNA Results section, we have provided some examples of what our DNA Paternity Test result looks like. In addition, we have also provided comprehensive information on how to interpret the results. 

*From what samples is it possible to extract DNA?
Human DNA can be extracted from any body fluid or tissue. Also DNA can be extracted from any item that is contaminated with body fluids. 


*Is it possible to Do DNA tests on hair samples?
For a DNA extraction from a hair sample it is best if the hair is freshly pulled out/ taken from the head and that the hair follicle is still intact to the hair strand to get the best extraction results. The results from nonstandard samples (as hair) depend very much on the condition of the sent sample. For example if hairs are sent, it is best if more than 5 hairs with root are pulled out from the head and sent for testing (hair without a root or shed hair Do not give good 

*Is it possible to Do infidelity testing by DNA analysis?
There are some circumstances when it is possible to know if a woman has been with another man (or vice versa). For example, garments, sheets etc. that would probably have semen, saliva or similar on them ca be analysed. Our laboratory could perform a presumptive test to detect the presence of semen or saliva. DNA tests can be also performed to determine if semen+ ome from the person requesting the test or from another person. 

*What can be Done if the alleged father Doesn't want to give his DNA sample but a member of his family is willing to?
It is possible to Do paternity testing if a relative of the alleged father is tested. If only the child and relative of alleged father are tested, the results may not be completely conclusive. If the mother's DNA sample is available for the testing, the results will be more conclusive. Please refer to our DNA Relationship Testing section for more information on relationship testing. 

*How long can the DNA samples survive?
The DNA extracted from saliva (blood or some other biological material) can be stored for a number of years. Obviously the DNA sample has to be stored properly. If saliva swabs are used, it's important to leave swabs to dry completely before being placed in an envelope and sending to the laboratory for DNA testing.

*what is thid?
it is a form of disease. 

*How many children are affected by sex trafficking?
achild is considered any individual below the age of 18. Because of the inherently unlawful nature of sex trafficking, exact numbers are difficult to come by but estimates range from one to three million worldwide. 

*I have heard human trafficking occurs abroad but how common is it in the United States?
Because human trafficking is an illegal practice, tracking actual numbers is difficult. However, it is a growing Domestic problem with estimates of 14,500 to 17,500 foreign nationals, primarily women and children, trafficked into the US every year. Far more are trafficked within the US.

*What are the main routes of HIVtransmission?
These are the main ways in which someone can become infected with HIV: . Unprotected penetrative sex with someone who is infected. . Injection or transfusion of contaminated blood or blood products, donations of semen (artificial insemination), skin grafts or organ transplants taken from someone who is infected. . From a mother who is infected to her baby; this can occur during pregnancy, at birth and through breast feeding. . Sharing unsterilized injection equipment that has previously been used by someone who is infected. 

*Can I become infected if my partner doesn't have HIV?
No. Like all sexually transmitted infections, HIVcannot be 'created', only passed on. If you are sure that your partner does not have HIV, then there is no risk of acquiring it, Even if you do have unprotected sex (whether it be vaginal, anal or oral). However, pregnancy and other sexually transmitted diseases (if your partner has one) remain a risk, so you should still use a condom or other suitable form of birth control wherever possible. 

*Can I become infected if my partner has HIV?
A partnership where one person is infected with HIVand the other is not can be described as a serodiscordant (or discordant) relationship. There is a risk of HIVtransmission if the discordant couple has unprotected sex. However, this risk can be greatly reduced with the use of condoms during vaginal, anal and oral sex. Both partners in a discordant sexual relationship should take on the responsibility of protecting one another from HIVinfection. 

*How safe is oral sex?
Although it is possible to become infected with HIVthrough oral sex, the risk of becoming infected in this way is much lower than the risk of infection via unprotected sexual intercourse with a man or woman. When giving oral sex to a man (sucking or licking a man's penis) a person could become infected with HIVif infected semen came into contact with damaged and receding gums, or any cuts or sores they might have in their mouth. Giving oral sex to a woman (licking a woman's vulva or vagina) is also considered relatively low risk. Transmission could take place if infected sexual fluids from a woman got into the mouth of her partner. The likelihood of infection might be increased if there is menstrual blood involved or if the woman is infected with another sexually transmitted disease. The likelihood of either a man or a woman becoming infected with HIVas a result of receiving oral sex is extremely low, as saliva does not contain infectious quantities of HIV. More information can be found in our oral sex and HIVpage. 

*What are the chances of becoming infected with HIVif he doesn't come inside me?
Whilst research suggests that high concentrations of HIVcan sometimes be detected in precum, it is difficult to judge whether HIVis present in sufficient quantities for infection to occur. To guard against the possibility of infection with HIVor any other STD it is best to practice safer sex, i.e. sex with a condom. 

*Is deep kissing a route of HIVtransmission?
Deep or openmouthed kissing is a very low risk activity in terms of HIVtransmission. HIVis only present in saliva in very minute amounts, insufficient to cause infection with HIV. There has been only one documented case of someone becoming infected with HIVthrough kissing; a result of exposure to infected blood during openmouthed kissing. If you or your partner have blood in your mouth, you should avoid kissing until the bleeding stops. 

*are lesbians or other women who have sex with women at risk for HIV?
Lesbians/bisexual women are not at high risk of contracting HIVthrough womantowoman sex. very few women are known to have passed HIVon to other women sexually, though it is theoretically possible if infected vaginal fluids or blood from an HIVpositive partner enter the other woman's vagina (perhaps on fingers or sex toys). AvERT has more information about lesbians, bisexual women and HIV. 

*Is unprotected anal intercourse more of an HIVrisk than vaginal or oral sex?
Unprotected anal intercourse does carry a higher risk than most other forms of sexual activity. The lining of the rectum has fewer cells than that of the vagina, and therefore can be damaged more easily, causing bleeding during intercourse. This can then be a route into the bloodstream for infected sexual fluids or blood. There is also a risk to the insertive partner during anal intercourse, though this is lower than the risk to the receptive partner. 

*Does 'fingering' during sex carry a risk of HIVtransmission?
Inserting a finger into someone's anus or vagina would only be an HIVrisk if the finger had cuts or sores on it and if there was direct contact with HIVinfected blood, vaginal fluids or semen from the other person. There might also be a risk if the person doing the fingering had HIVand their finger was bleeding. 

*Is there a connection between HIVand other STDs (sexually transmitted diseases)?
HIVand other STDs can impact upon each other. The presence of STDs in an HIVinfected person can increase the risk of HIVtransmission. This can be through a genital ulcer which could bleed or through increased genital discharge. An HIVnegative person who has an STD can be at increased risk of becoming infected with HIVthrough sex. This can happen if the STD causes ulceration or breaks in the skin (e.g. syphilis or herpes), or if it stimulates an immune response in the genital area (e.g. chlamydia or gonorrhea). HIVtransmission is more likely in those with ulcerative STDs than nonulcerative. Using condoms during sex is the best way to prEvent the sexual transmission of diseases, including HIV. AvERT.org has more information on STDs. 
*Can I become infected with HIVthrough normal social contact/activities such as shaking hands/toilet seats/swimming pools/sharing cutlery/kissing/sneezes and coughs?
No. HIVis not an airborne, waterborne or foodborne virus, and does not survive for very long outside the human body. Therefore ordinary social contact such as kissing, shaking hands, coughing and sharing cutlery does not result in the virus being passed from one person to another. 

*Can I become infected with HIVfrom needles on movie/cinema seats?
There have been a number of stories circulating via the Internet and email, about people becoming infected from needles left on cinema seats and in coin return slots. These rumours appear to have no factual basis. For HIVinfection to take place in this way the needle would need to contain infected blood with a high level of infectious virus. If a person was then pricked with an infected needle, they could become infected, but there is still only a 0.4 perc. chance of this happening. Although discarded needles can transfer blood and bloodborne illnesses such as Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV, the risk of infection taking place in this way is extremely low. Further information on this topic can be found on the CDC website. 

*Is there a risk of HIVtransmission when having a tattoo, body piercing or visiting the barbers?
If instruments contaminated with blood are not sterilized between clients then there is a risk of HIVtransmission. However, people who carry out body piercing or tattooing should follow procedures called 'universal precautions', which are designed to prEvent the transmission of blood borne infections such as HIVand Hepatitis B. When visiting the barbers there is no risk of infection unless the skin is cut and infected blood gets into the wound. Traditional 'cutthroat' razors used by barbers now have disposable blades, which should only be used once, thus eliminating the risk from bloodborne infections such as Hepatitis and HIV. 

*Are healthcare workers at risk from HIVthrough contact with HIVinfected patients?
The risk to healthcare workers being exposed to HIVis extremely low, especially if they follow universal healthcare precautions. Everyday casual contact does not expose anyone, including healthcare workers, to HIV. The main risk is through accidental injuries from needles and other sharp objects that may be contaminated with HIV. It has been estimated that the risk of infection from a needlestick injury is less than 1 percent. In the UK for instance, there have been five documented cases of HIVtransmission through occupational exposure in the healthcare setting, the last being in 1999. In the US, there were 57 documented cases of occupational HIVtransmission up to 2006. The risk posed by a needlestick injury may be higher if it is a deep injury; if it is made with a hollow bore needle; if the source patient has a high viral load; or if the sharp instrument is visibly contaminated with blood. 

*Am I at risk of becoming infected with HIVwhen visiting the doctor or dentist?
Transmission of HIVin a healthcare setting is extremely rare. All health professionals are required to follow infection control procedures when caring for any patient. These procedures are called universal precautions for infection control. They are designed to protect both patients and healthcare professionals from the transmission of bloodborne diseases such as Hepatitis B and HIV. 

*If blood splashes into my eye, or I get some in my mouth, can I become infected with HIV?
Research suggests that the risk of HIVinfection in this way is extremely small. A very small number of people usually in a healthcare setting have become infected with HIVas a result of blood splashes in the eye. Blood in the mouth carries an Even lower risk. The lining of the mouth is very protective, so the only way HIVcould enter the bloodstream would be if the person had a cut, open sore or area of inflammation somewhere in their mouth or throat (if the blood was swallowed). Even then, the person would have to get a fairly significant quantity of fresh blood (i.e. an amount that can be clearly seen or tasted) directly into the region of the cut or sore for there to be a risk. HIVis diluted by saliva and easily killed by stomach acid once the blood is swallowed. 

*Can I become infected with HIVthrough biting?
Infection with HIVin this way is unusual. There have only been a couple of documented cases of HIVtransmission resulting from biting. In these particular cases, severe tissue tearing and damage were reported in addition to the presence of blood. 

*Can I be infected with HIVthrough contact with animals such as dogs and cats?
No. HIVis a Human Immunodeficiency virus. It only affects humans. There are some other types of immunodeficiency viruses that specifically affect cats and other primates, namely the Feline Immunodeficiency virus (FIv) and Simian Immunodeficiency virus (SIv). These viruses are of no risk to humans. Some people have expressed concern that they could become infected if scratched by an animal that has previously scratched an HIVpositive person. This is exceptionally unlikely, and there are no documented cases of transmission occurring in this way. 


*Can I get HIVfrom a mosquito?
No,it is not possible to get HIVfrom mosquitoes. When taking blood from someone, mosquitoes do not inject blood from any previous person. The only thing that a mosquito injects is saliva, which acts as a lubricant and enables it to feed more efficiently. 

*Can HIVbe transmitted in household settings?
HIVis overwhelmingly transmitted through sexual contact, through intravenous drug use, through infected blood donations and from mother to child during pregnancy, birth and breast feeding. HIVis not transmitted through everyday social contact. There have however been a few cases in which it is thought that family members have infected each other through ways other than those stated above. A case in Australia in the late 1990s involved two sisters. Both tested positive within a month of each other. The risk exposure for the older sister was identified as being sexual contact she had with a Russian man. The younger sister had had no obvious risk exposures, and investigators concluded that the only possible risk exposure was them sharing a razor to shave their legs. Further analysis established that they did have the same Russian virus strain, not commonly found in Australia. The other case involved a mother and son, again in Australia, who both tested HIVpositive. He had had risk exposures in Thailand some years before, whereas the mother could not identify a possible exposure. The son had had the skin condition psoriasis some time earlier, and the mother application of the cream to his skin lesions was identified as the only possible route of infection. Analysis showed that they both had the same strain, found in Thailand and not common in Australia. Whilst HIVtransmission between family members and members of the same household is possible, it occurs in extremely low numbers and documented cases are very rare. 

*Can I become infected with HIVif I inject drugs and share the needles with someone else, without sterilizing them?
There is a possibility of becoming infected with HIVif you share injecting equipment with someone who has the virus. If HIVinfected blood remains within the bore (inside) of the needle or in the syringe and someone else then uses it to inject themselves, that blood can be flushed into the bloodstream. Sharing needles, syringes, spoons, filters or water can pass on the virus. Disinfecting equipment between uses can reduce the likelihood of transmission, but does not eliminate it. More information can be found in our Injecting drugs, drug users and HIVpage. 

*Can I transmit HIVto my baby during pregnancy or breast feeding?
An HIVinfected pregnant woman can pass the virus on to her unborn baby either before or during birth. HIVcan also be passed on during breast feeding. If a woman knows that she is infected with HIV, there are drugs she can take to greatly reduce the chances of her child becoming infected. Other ways to lower the risk include choosing to have a caesarean section delivery and not breast feeding. Read more about HIVand pregnancy. 

*Does donating blood or having a blood transfusion mean that I am putting myself at risk from HIV?
Some people have been infected through a transfusion of infected blood. In most countries, however, all the blood used for transfusions is now tested for HIV. In those countries where the blood has been tested, HIVinfection through blood transfusions is now extremely rare. Blood products, such as those used by people with haemophilia, are now heattreated to make them safe. Donating blood at an approved donation centre should carry no risk, as all equipment should be sterile and blood collection needles are not reused. 

*Can HIVbe transmitted outside of the body?
Whilst HIVmay live for a short while outside of the body, HIVtransmission has not been reported as a result of contact with spillages or small traces of blood, semen or other bodily fluids. This is partly because HIVdies quite quickly once exposed to the air, and also because spilled fluids would have to get into a person's bloodstream to infect them. Scientists agree that HIVdoes not survive well in the environment, making the chance of environmental transmission remote. To obtain data on the survival of HIV, laboratory studies usually use artificially high concentrations of laboratorygrown virus. Although these concentrations of HIVcan be kept alive for days or Even weeks under controlled conditions, studies have shown that drying of these high concentrations of HIVreduces the amount of infectious virus by 90 to 99 percent within a few hours. Since the HIVconcentrations used in laboratory studies are much higher than those actually found in blood or other specimens, the real risk of HIVinfection from dried bodily fluids is probably close to zero. Incorrect interpretation of conclusions drawn from laboratory studies have unnecessarily alarmed some people. AvERT.org has additional facts about HIVand AIDS. 

*Does circumcision protect against HIV?
There is very strong evidence showing that circumcised men are about half as likely as uncircumcised men to acquire HIVthrough heterosexual sex. However, circumcision does not make a man immune to HIVinfection, it just means that it's less likely to happen. Male circumcision probably has little or no prEventive benefit for women. Read more about HIVand circumcision. 

*If I am taking antiretroviral drugs and have an 'undetectable' viral load, am I still infectious?
Even if your tests show that you have very low levels of HIVin your blood, the virus will not have been totally eradicated and you will still be capable of infecting others. Some drugs do not penetrate the genitals very well and so do not disable HIVas effectively there as they do in the blood. This means that while you may have little active virus showing up on blood tests, there may still be quite a lot of HIVin your semen or vaginal fluids. Transmission may be less likely when you have a low viral load, but it is still possible so you should always take appropriate precautions. For more information on this issue read AvERT's HIVtransmission and antiretroviral therapy briefing sheet. 

*If I am HIVpositive is there a greater risk of contracting Swine flu?
Currently, there does not seem to be a greater risk of contracting Swine flu if you are HIVpositive but as with all types of flu, there can be complications. It is normal for health services to advise that those living with HIVreceive a flu vaccine annually and this is also the case for swine flu. It has not been confirmed whether those with a CD4 cell count of less than 200 will be at a greater risk of complications but they should always seek medical advice from their HIVclinic if they start to suffer from flu like symptoms which persist or worsen despite antiretroviral treatment. It can be the case that they are not suffering from swine flu or flu but instead the symptoms could be an opportunistic infection, mistaken for flu. 

*What is the test FOR AIDS AND HIV?
The test is a test for the ANTIBODIES to HIV it is NOT a test for HIVand it is NOT a test for AIDS. If a person tests HIVpositive it means that there are antibodies present in the blood sample and the person is infected with HIV. OK, it gets tricky now: it can take between 2.5 weeks and 6 months for a person to show antibodies to HIV. Yet, HIVcan still be in the blood and can be transmitted to another person! We are all different and we all have different immune systems. This period of time for antibody development is called the Window . 

*Is oral sex risky?
Yes Oral sex can be very risky because there can be microscopic cuts in the mouth, on the penis and in the vagina. We know that HIVis in high concentrations in semen, pre cum and in vaginal fluids. Any time there is an opening for any of these fluids, there is a risk of HIVtransmission. Better to keep any of these fluids out of your mouth. Better yet, get to know the previous sexual history of your partner. Oral sex is pretty intimate stuff and you need to make sure you really want to get that personal with your partner. 

*If I get infected by AIDS, why can't I just take those AIDS drugs?
Dont Even think about it! These drugs are not the solution for everyone prEvention is! The specific statistics: 1) 30 of all people who take the HIV/AIDS drugs have to stop because of the terrible side effects (horrible diarrhea, immobilizing fatigue, constant vomiting, dementia, just to mention a few) and 30 50 have a strain of HIVthat builds up a tolerance and resistance to the drugs (the virus mutates or changes) and then the drugs are no longer effective. That means only 20perc. are doing OK. 2) One in every sEven of the people living with HIVhave a resistance to at least one of the 15 drugs available. In other words, they do not work for a lot of people, yet fortunately they are effective for some of our friends with HIV/AIDS. Other thoughts: 1. They are prohibitively expensive ($2,000/2 week drug supply). 2. They have to be taken on a strict regimen: 1 pill/2 hrs, 2 pills/4 hrs, 1 pill with food, 1 pill on empty stomach, 1 pill with high fat, etc. Who can take pills when there is violent vomiting? And one often takes 40 pills/day! 3. If one misses Even one dose, the virus becomes resistant and Even stronger causing the medication to become ineffective in combating the virus. 4. If one decides to start the HIV/AIDS medicines, it will be on your medical records which can cause future problems with medical insurance, school/college acceptance, getting a job, keeping an apartment, telling your family.there is still a terrible and needless discrimination for people living with HIV/AIDS. 

*If I get infected by AIDS, I'm going to be REALLY mad at my partner?
Hey.Not so fast with the accusations.Why didn't you say NO? Why didn't you use a condom? The only person you can blame is YOURSELF. Where was your feeling of selfworth?You have a choice please make the correct and safe choice. HIVis prEventable.Don't get infected in the first place.Either be abstinent (truly the best decision) or if already sexually active, you have to use a latex condom properly and every time you have sex. 

*Why should I get involved with PEP/LA?
We have known about the dangers of HIV/AIDS for more than 20 years. We know that an HIVinfection is associated with three (3) specific activities (unprotected sex, bloodtoblood contact, infected mother to child). We know the behaviors to avoid and we know how to prEvent HIV/AIDS (abstinence, condoms, sterile needles). But why are people still getting infected with HIV? In the world more than 16,000 people get HIV/day; 2000 of these are babies. Even in the USA, one person is infected every 15 minutes. WHY? There is a feeling of denial ("It won't happen to me!"); peer pressure and the use of alcohol and drugs contribute to risky behaviors. "I know my partner", "I trust my partner..." hah! can you really trust that partner? hey, if you can't talk about sex (protection, previous partners) then perhaps you're not ready to have sex. We have to promote dialogue and communication about sexuality. Poverty is directly associated with high numbers of people with HIV/AIDS. Many mothers have sex to feed their hungry babies; there are students who have sex for school fees. You can make a difference.Talk to your friends and family about how to prEvent HIV/AIDS. Talk to your peers about the importance of stopping discrimination of people with 

*What is government's approach to HIVand AIDS?
Government is implementing a comprehensive plan to deal with HIVand AIDS, which combines prEvention, to ensure that those who are not infected remain so, with treatment, care and support for those infected or affected. It is based on a fiveyear strategic plan adopted in 2000 which has unfolded into what is probably the largest programme in the world, sustained by a budget which has expanded and is set to grow still further in order to sustain it. Essential to the programme is the strengthening of the national health system. Government expenditure on HIVand AIDS increased substantially over years it grew from R30 million in 1994 to over R3 billion in 2005/06. The World Health Organisation's progress report on the expansion of AIDS treatment, released in June 2005, noted that: South Africa has committed US$1 billion over the next three years to scaling up antiretroviral treatment, by far the largest budget allocation of any low or middleincome country'. The programme's impact is reflected in very high levels of awareness; changes in behaviour, especially among the young; stabilisation in recent years of the level of prevalence which had been rising fast; and the creation of infrastructure to support and sustain counselling, testing, care and treatment across the country. Critical to successful implementation is an active partnership of all of society with government. The partnership is embodied in the South Africa National AIDS Council and expressed in action which sees government, communities and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) working together to implement all aspects of the comprehensive plan. 

*What progress has been made in implementing the country's comprehensive plan?
Progress has been made in the various aspects of the plan: . in accordance with the plan, each of the 53 health districts in the country now has at least one service point providing comprehensive HIV and AIDSrelated services, including antiretroviral treatment (ART), from prEvention to terminal palliative care . 250 laboratories have been certified to provide support to the programme . three pharmacovigilance centres have been established to monitor and investigate adverse reaction to treatment. By the end of June 2006, over 178 635 patients had been initiated for ART and there is no stock out in all facilities. To date, 254 facilities are implementing the comprehensive plan covering 72,5 perc. of the country's subdistricts. Fortythree CD4 counts, 11 viral load and sEven PCR machines are operational in laboratories across the country. 

*What place does prEvention have in South Africa 's HIVand AIDS programme?
South Africa's approach emphasises the centrality of prEvention, so that those not infected remain so; and the importance of strengthening the national health system to provide a complete continuum of care and other interventions that would mitigate the impact of HIVand AIDS and other diseases. A significant reduction in sexually transmitted infections has been reported over the last few years due to communication and treatment programme Government programmes are complemented by privatesector, NGO and civilsociety initiatives. A new phase of the awareness campaign started in September 2002, joining government with partners like loveLife, and focusing on youth prEvention, support for orphans and vulnerable children, and living positively. PrEvention activities have further been strengthened through the Khomanani (Caring Together) Campaign, a multimedia mass communication campaign supporting all aspects of the comprehensive programme and driving the ABC message for sexual behavioural change. The Khomanani Campaign is being decentralised to provinces. The distribution of condoms increased to 386 million male and 1,3 million female condoms in 2005/06. The prEvention progamme includes prEvention of mothertochild transmission, with 3 000 facilities in operation, covering 87perc. of health facilities, Postexposure prophylaxis is provided in almost all hospitals and trauma centres for sexual assault survivors and health professionals exposed to HIV. Health facilities providing voluntary counselling and testing increased from 3 369 in 2004/05 to 4 930 in 2005/06. 

*How is the country approaching human resources in the public health system?
More than 1 060 health professionals have been recruited to support the programme and 9 107 health professionals have been trained in the management, care and treatment of HIVand AIDS. Government is also improving working conditions so that it can recruit and retain more health professionals. This includes providing scarce skills allowances for certain categories of health professionals (doctors, pharmacists and specialist nurses) and rural allowances for health professionals working in less developed parts of the country. This is in addition to steadily improving salary packages. 

*What treatment is offered in the public health sector?
Treatment at public health facilities is covered in the Operational Plan for Comprehensive Treatment and Care for HIVand AIDS in the country, which was approved by Cabinet in November 2003. This covers the areas of counselling, good nutrition and healthy lifestyles, treatment of opportunistic infections, traditional medicine and antiretroviral drugs. Public health facilities have a duty to treat opportunistic infections, irrespective of the patient's HIVstatus. The Department of Health is continuing with the training of healthcare workers in the management of opportunistic infections. Currently, all health facilities are providing treatment for opportunistic infections. Nutritional supplements are provided to those who need them, as part of the comprehensive response to HIVand AIDS, as a complement to the appropriate forms of treatment. About 480 000 qualifying TB and HIVpositive patients have accessed this service since April 2004. 

*What is done to provide care and support and to fight discrimination?
Support and care for those affected by HIVand AIDS is expanding, through increased governmental social grant registration and increases in grants, as well as growing home and communitybased care programmes. There are 45 step vcare facilities, 732 support groups and 1 176 homebased care organizations providing services in the communities. The public health system provides nutritional supplements to patients with HIVand AIDS and/or TB and this has therefore increased macro and micronutrient requirements. The Khomanani Campaign is tapping public willingness to help alleviate the suffering caused by HIVand AIDS. A tool kit on how to live positively with HIVand AIDS has been developed in collaboration with people living with the disease. It aims to put faces and share experiences to reduce the stigma, and is being distributed to support groups. About 10 million Information Education and Communication (IEC) materials were distributed in 2005. Government efforts are further complemented by initiatives of the private sector, and nongovernmental, communitybased and faithbased organizations aimed at addressing the impact of HIVand AIDS on individuals and the broader society. 

*Where can I learn more about Khomanani?
Khomanani is a dynamic governmentled communication campaign funded and driven by the Department of Health. Learn more about Khomanani. Where can I find speeches and statements on HIV/AIDS by government leaders? You can find information and documents on HIV/AIDS on the Key Issues page. You can also go directly to the Speeches and Statements index page. Source: Department of Health 

*How can I tell if I have HIVor AIDS?
The only way to tell if you have HIVis to take an HIVtest (usually an HIVantibody test). You cannot tell if someone has HIVor AIDS just by looking at them, and HIVcannot be diagnosed through symptoms. AIDS and HIVsymptoms are not specific, and may be indicative of many other illnesses, which is why an HIVtest is the only way to receive a definitive diagnosis. back to top 

*Why should I take an HIVtest?
If you have never had unprotected sex, shared drug injecting equipment, or been exposed to HIVduring a medical procedure or at work, then there is probably very little likelihood of you having HIV, and no real reason for you to take an HIVtest. If there is a possibility that you have been exposed to HIV, then a test is always the best option. Many people are very frightened of taking an HIVtest in case they test positive. This can mean they spend many months, sometimes Even years, worrying about the possibility of having HIV, often unnecessarily. In almost every case, it is better to know your status than not to know: If you are diagnosed as HIVnegative, your mind will instantly be put at rest and you can stop worrying and get on with your life. If you are diagnosed as HIVpositive: . You can be offered emotional support, and advice on what to do next. . You can have you health assessed and begin antiretroviral treatment if necessary (and available). . You can also take measures to ensure that you protect your partner and (if you are a woman) any future children from getting HIV. . You can be reassured that if you do fall ill, a doctor is going to take your symptoms more seriously. . You can start to make plans for the future. Learning that you have HIVmay be a shock, but it can also lead people to do amazing things that they may never have considered before! If it is inconvenient or risky for you to take a test because of personal circumstances, you should wait until it does become possible, and in the interim, ensure that you use condoms with your partner, or take other measures to protect their health and yours. Read more about HIVtesting and learning that you are positive. back to top 


*When should I take an HIVtest?
Though a person who is infected with HIVwill become infectious themselves very rapidly (within a day or so), they will normally have to wait a while before an HIVtest will produce an accurate result. The length of time a person should wait before taking an HIVtest will depend on the type of test they are taking. In the vast majority of cases, the standard test that will be offered at an HIVtesting centre will be an HIVantibody test. The HIVantibody test looks for antibodies to the virus in a person's blood. For most people these antibodies take 6 weeks to 3 months to develop. In very rare cases, it can take up to 6 months. It is extremely rare for a person to take any longer then 6 months to develop detectable antibodies. Getting tested before 3 months have elapsed may result in an unclear test result, as an infected person may not yet have developed antibodies to HIV. These 3 months are known as the 'window period'. So it is best to wait for at least 3 months after the last time you were at risk before taking the test. Some test centres may recommend testing again at 6 months, just to be extra sure, though in most cases this is not necessary. If you are waiting to take an HIVantibody test, it is vital that you do not put yourself at risk through further exposures to HIVduring this time period. This means you should practice safe sex and not share needles. Any further exposure to HIVmay mean a negative HIVtest result is not accurate (unless of course you wait another three months after this exposure). The vast majority of HIVtests that are given in clinics are antibody tests, though other types of test may be available in some clinics. 

*I don't think I can wait three months for a test for HIV could I get an accurate result more quickly?
The HIVantibody test is the most commonly used test, and generally provides the most reliable results. However, other tests that detect the presence of HIVdirectly are available. Tests such as the HIVPCR test can usually give accurate results within three weeks of infection. However, not all clinics will offer these tests, and you may have to pay for them if they do. You should ask you healthcare provider for more information if you wish to take an HIVtest before three months have elapsed. back to top 

*What is an HIVantibody test?
An antibody test is the most common type of test used to diagnose HIVin individuals. This test shows whether a person has been infected with HIVby looking for HIVantibodies in a person's blood. When HIVenters a person's body, special proteins are produced, which are known as antibodies. Antibodies are the body's response to an infection. So if a person has specific antibodies against HIVin their blood, it means they have been infected with HIV(an exception is the case of an HIVnegative baby born to a positive mother, who will retain her antibodies for some months). Depending on the clinic, the test results from an antibody test can come back in under an hour (in the case of rapid HIVantibody tests), or may take a few days or weeks (in the case of standard antibody tests). back to top 

*How is the HIVtest performed?
When you attend to get tested you will see a doctor, trained counsellor, nurse or health care worker in private. He or she will explain what the test involves and what the result means, or give you a leaflet that explains these things. Normally a small sample of blood will be taken from your arm, and will be tested there and then, or will be sent to a laboratory and tested. In some countries, oral tests are also available which do not require the use of needles. The test is always strictly confidential and only goes ahead if you agree. Your personal doctor will not be told about the test without your permission. Sometimes you will have to make a second appointment to get your results, as many doctors prefer to give test results in person. In some countries, negative test results may be given out over the phone or via a text message or email if you give your permission for this to happen. People with positive or indeterminate (unclear or unreadable) results will always be asked to make a facetoface appointment so they can receive counselling from a trained professional. 

*What is a rapid test?
a rapid HIVtest is also an antibody test. The advantage of a rapid test is that you do not have to return to get your test result results are usually available in about 30 minutes. Rapid tests are singleuse and do not require laboratory facilities or highly trained staff. This makes rapid tests particularly suitable for use in countries with limited resources. Though the test is 'rapid' at providing results, it is still an antibody test, so it is advisable to wait three months before taking it. 

*What is a p24 antigen test?
a p24 antigen test is another type of HIVtest. Antigens are the substances found on a foreign body or germ that trigger the production of antibodies in the body. The antigen on HIVthat most commonly provokes an antibody response is the protein P24. Early in HIVinfection, P24 is produced in excess and can be detected in the blood serum (although as HIVbecomes fully established in the body it will fade to undetectable levels). P24 antigen tests are not usually used for general HIVdiagnostic purposes, as they have a very low sensitivity and they only work before antibodies are produced in the period immediately after HIVinfection. Some modern tests combine a P24 antigen test with a standard antibody test, meaning diagnosis during the three month 'window period' is more likely. 

*What are NAT, DNA, RNA and PCR tests?
HIVtests that detect the genetic material of HIVitself (rather than antibodies or antigens) are known as PCR tests. PCR stands for Polymerase Chain Reaction and is a common way of testing for a variety of different organisms. The overall process of extracting and amplifying the genetic material of an organism (in this case HIV) and then testing for it with a PCR test is called Nucleicacid Amplification Testing or NAT. NAT tests generally take two forms: DNA PCR tests and RNA PCR tests. RNA PCR tests are most frequently used for screening blood donations and donor organs for HIV, while DNA PCR tests are used for testing newborn babies born to HIVpositive mothers. Both types of test can be used to measure the amount of virus that is present within a person's body (when they will usually be referred to as 'viral load' tests). NAT is sometimes also offered for diagnosing individuals, but because it is costly and complicated to perform, antibody testing is far more common in testing clinics. NAT generally gives positive results much sooner than standard antibody testing would, making it useful in situations where early diagnosis is necessary. An RNA PCR test will produce a positive test result within two to three weeks. A DNA PCR test will provide positive results within three to four weeks (sometimes sooner). As long as the recommended amount of time has elapsed before taking the test (people taking the test for personal diagnosis should ask their testing clinic if they are unsure), the test will be able to give a very accurate result. False positive results are more common than false negatives due to the PCR test's sensitivity, so all positive results must be double checked using a standard antibody test. 

*Can I get tested Howedower without vvisiting a clinic?
It is generally recommended that the HIVtest is done in a health care setting. However, in some countries 'home sampling' kits are available. With a home sampling kit, a person can take a sample (usually a blood or oral fluid sample), send it to a laboratory for testing and then a few days later phone up for the results. If the result is positive then a professional counsellor will provide emotional support and referrals. For home sampling, the major advantages are convenience, speed, privacy and anonymity. There is one company in the USA that offers an FDAapproved home sampling kit for HIV. Many home sampling kits that have not been approved by the FDA are being marketed online. One company in the UK offers home sampling services using oral fluid instead of blood. It is not recommended to buy any other sort of 'home testing' kit, as there is no guarantee it will provide accurate results. 

*I have seen 'instant HIVtests' being sold on the internet are these recommended?
In the vast majority of cases, instant tests sold on the internet (with the exception of the home sampling kits mentioned above) have not been assessed for their suitability for use at home, meaning the results they give cannot always be trusted. Furthermore, using an HIVtest kit at home means that the results are learned on the spot without any counselling or advice available. All reactive test results must be confirmed by further testing at a clinic, but individuals may not always know where to go in such circumstances. In the Event of an incorrect result, there may be no legal recourse. For these reasons, in many countries it is illegal to sell HIVtest kits to the public. There is currently some debate about allowing them to be sold in the USA and the UK. AvERT opposes the legalization of the sale of home testing kits in the UK because of the lack of posttest counselling and the danger that individuals may not perform their test correctly. 


*What is the difference between anonymous and confidential testing?
Confidential testing means that the results of any HIVtest performed will not be revealed to anybody except designated clinic staff, and in some cases, specific public health officials. Confidential testing will usually require a person to give their details (name, age, address) to the clinic performing the test. They then have to contact or return to the clinic after to get the results (unless a rapid test is used). In the UK most confidential testing is done at GenitoUrinary Medicine (GUM) or sexual health clinics. The clinics are legally bound to not reveal personal details and test results. GPs and private doctors also perform HIVtests, but the fact a person has had an HIVtest, and the results, will appear on their medical records. In other countries, such as America, clinics have to notify public health officials of a person's personal details if they test positive for HIV. In cases where an individual does not want their name associated with their test, anonymous HIVtesting may also be offered. Anonymous testing can either be ensured by a patient giving a false name and address (which can create difficulties if a person tests positive and needs to be informed), or can be specifically requested. In the US, a patient requesting anonymous testing will be given a unique identifying code. No official record of them being tested will be made and no identifying details will be passed on to public health authorities in case of a positive result. It is then up to the person being tested to contact the clinic/laboratory for the results. 

*I Am pregnant should I have an HIVtest?
In many countries you will be offered an HIVtest when you are pregnant as part of your antenatal care. It is your decision whether to take it or not. However, if you are infected with HIVand do not know it, you cannot benefit from treatment that can prEvent HIVfrom being passed onto your baby. If you test result is positive, this means that you could pass HIVto your baby during pregnancy, during birth or by breast feeding. However, there are certain things a woman can do to minimize the risk of HIVbeing passed to her child. These include: . taking antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy . taking antiretroviral drugs during labour . choosing caesarean section as the method of delivery . giving the baby a short course of antiretroviral therapy after birth . formulafeeding rather than breastfeeding. AvERT.org has more about prEventing mothertochild transmission of HIV, HIVtesting in pregnancy and HIVand pregnancy. back to top 

*Can my baby have an HIVantibody test?
During pregnancy and breast feeding, a mother will pass on many essential antibodies to her baby to enable the child to fight infection. All babies born to mothers with HIVare therefore born with HIVantibodies (though not necessarily HIVitself). If an HIVantibody test is given to a newborn baby then it will always give a positive result if the mother is infected with HIV, regardless of whether the baby actually has HIV. Babies who are not infected lose their antibodies by the time they are around 18 months old. So it is only after your baby is 18 months old that the HIVantibody test will give an accurate result. However, most babies can be diagnosed as either infected or uninfected by the time they are 3 months old by using a different test, called the DNA PCR test. The PCR test is more sensitive than the HIVtest and looks for the presence of HIVitself, not antibodies. If you are worried that your baby may have been infected, you should speak to your doctor. AvERT.org has more about HIVand pregnancy. 

*How long must I wait for my results?
Depending on the test used and where it is done, it can take anything from a few minutes, to a few weeks to get the result back. You should ask your doctor at the time of testing how long the results will take. For more specific information about results, see the different test sections above. 

*Do I need to have an HIVtest to visit or work in another country?
Some countries, including the USA, do not allow people with HIVto enter the country, or require HIVtesting or proof of a negative test result before they will issue a visa or work permit. A full list of international immigration regulations related to HIVcan be found on the National AIDS Manual's 'countries and their entry restrictions' page. 

*Will having a positive HIVtest result affect my ability to get insurance or a mortgage?
If you find that you are infected with HIV, you may find it very hard to get life insurance from a regular insurer in most countries. This may in turn affect your ability to get a mortgage. If you discover you have HIVand need to get a mortgage, you should opt for a provider that does not require you to take out life insurance. In some countries with high HIVprevalence, such as South Africa, you may be able to find a specialist insurer that will provide you with cover. Any insurance you had before you were tested will not normally be affected if you test positive. If you take a test and discover you are not infected, this should not affect your ability to get insurance either. These days, you should not be asked if you have ever had an HIVtest and tested negative. Many countries now have insurers that will provide travel insurance to HIVpositive people. You should contact your local HIVand AIDS organisation for more information if you are planning to go abroad. back to top 

*Can an employer ask me to have an HIVtest?
This depends on the country you are in. In many countries, it will only be legal for employers to test employees if they do a job that requires them to have no serious health problems (such as working in the armed forces for example). If you are asked to take an HIVtest for work that you don't believe is necessary, you should contact a legal advisor, or an AIDS organisation in your country for advice. 

*Will I be tested for HIVif I give blood?
Yes. All developed countries and most developing countries test donated blood (and organs) for HIVand other infections such as hepatitis, to prEvent transmission to recipients. Becoming a blood donor is the most common reason for being tested for HIVin the UK and US.If the test result is positive, the blood donation service will inform the person and advise them what to do next. In some lowincome countries, a lack of resources means that donated blood isn't routinely tested for HIV. If you are worried you might have HIV, it is better to visit an HIVtesting clinic to receive a test, than to donate blood in the hope that you will be told. 

*Do tests detect HIV2 and all subtypes of HIV1?
All antibody tests should detect the most common subtypes of HIV1. The majority of HIVtests will also now detect HIV2 and all but the very rarest of HIV1 subtypes (usually only found in endemic areas in West Africa). A test that specifically detects the rare HIV1 group O is also now available, though in most cases, a standard antibody test would identify a group O infection. For detailed information, see our page about HIVsubtypes. 

*Do flu vaccinations or pregnancy cause false positive HIVtest results?
There are a number of factors, including recent flu vaccination and multiple pregnancies, that may make people more likely to receive a false positive result in the initial screening test for HIV, though such results are still unusual. Confirmatory tests such as the Western blot are used to distinguish between these false positives and genuine HIVinfection. The risk of a false positive during confirmatory testing is extremely tiny around 1 in 250,000 for the Western blot, for example. 

*What is an indeterminate Western blot result?
The Western blot test is used as a confirmatory test in the US and some other countries. This test can separately detect antibodies to various HIVproteins. If several types of antibodies are detected then the result is positive; if no antibodies are detected then the result is negative. If the test appears to show only one or two types of antibodies then the result is called indeterminate, or inconclusive. There are two main reasons why this can happen. Firstly, it may be that the person has only recently become infected with HIV, and has not developed a full immune response. Secondly, the test may be showing a weak reaction to other antibodies unrelated to HIV. An indeterminate result indicates that further testing is required. Either the Western blot may be repeated a few weeks later, or a different test (such as PCR) may be used. back to top 

*What are the differences between 'mandatory', 'voluntary' and 'routine' HIVtesting?
Mandatory HIVtesting means that you have no choice over whether to be tested or not. Essentially it is a compulsory test that you cannot refuse. voluntary testing on the other hand is just that: voluntary. It means you have to actively and freely choose to take an HIVtest. Routine testing is an HIVtest that is offered to everyone within a certain population (for example, pregnant women, or people within a certain age group) on a routine basis. It is also referred to as 'optout' screening, which means the test is automatically performed unless the individual concerned raises an objection and 'opts out'. Both voluntary and routine HIVtests require a person's full written or verbal consent. Because it restricts freedom of choice, and can result in stigmatisation and discrimination for anyone who tests positive, mandatory testing is generally seen as an unsuitable way of combating HIVand AIDS. For screening a certain population for HIV, routine optout policies are therefore considered to be more effective from both a public health and an ethical point of view 

*Why is HIVsuch an issue in the developing world?
Almost 95perc. of people with HIVlive in poor countries, where not everyone can go to school and learn about the virus. Even when information is available, many people do not have access to clinics and hospitals where they can get tested for sexually transmitted infections like HIVor access condoms. Poor people in developing countries are also often faced with difficult choices such as going hungry or making money in whatever way possible to have food and often this involves selling sex and so increasing risk to HIV. 

*What work is Action Aid doing on HIV?
action Aid advocates that people should have a life of dignity in the face of HIVand Aids and has developed innovative models of working at community levels to empower communities to change circumstances that make them vulnerable. As women's lack of power has been identified as one of the key drivers of HIVtransmission and women's rights are a strategic priority for Action Aid, our HIVand Aids work is closely linked with working to ensure women can realize their rights. People living with HIVand AIDS are denied many of their basic rights such as employment, safety, a sexual and family life and to living free from violence. Action Aid supports organizations of people living with HIVto reclaim their rights and be involved in decisions and policies that affect their lives. 

*How do people catch HIV?
HIVis carried in certain bodily fluids including semen, blood, breast milk and vaginal fluids and is passed on when these fluids enter the body. Most people become infected through . Unprotected sex with an infected person . Using needles or other injecting equipment which have been used by an infected person . Being born to an infected mother . Receiving blood or tissue donated by an infected person HIVcannot be transmitted through intact external skin or through the air. Saliva, sweat and urine do not contain enough of the virus to infect someone. 

*What are the best ways to avoid catching the virus?
Apart from condoms, HIVprEvention tools for women such as female condoms and microbicides a cream or gel which could be applied before sex to prEvent HIVinfection have recently been developed, enabling women to protect themselves without relying on their partner. A vaginal microbicide could be available in less than five years and if widely distributed, they could save millions of women's lives. 

*If condoms are part of the answer, why don't more people use them?
PrEventing HIVis more complex than simply using condoms. Everyone has the right to choose to have children and it is not possible to have children while using condoms. Not everyone in poorer countries can afford condoms and they are not always easily available for free. Millions of women and girls do not have the option to say no to unprotected sex and Even within marriage many women are often not in a position to insist that their partners remain faithful or always use condoms. 

*The US and other countries often promoting sexual abstinence as a solution, what is Action Aid's view?
action Aid is opposed to health promotion which focuses only on abstinence from sex or seeks only to promote "faithfulness". Strategies such as abstinence only give partial information which often make women and girls more vulnerable to HIV. Sex education should ensure that young people are empowered to protect themselves from HIV, rather than simply imposing moralistic ideals. 

*What is HIV?
HIVor human immunodeficiency virus is a virus that is known to result in AIDS. This virus may be transmitted from one individual to another through sexual and bloodtoblood contact. HIVpositive pregnant women may also transfer this virus to their baby during pregnancy, delivery or through breastfeeding. 

*What is AIDS?How is it caused?
aIDS stands for Acquired ImmunoDeficiency Syndrome. An HIVpositive person may be given a diagnosis of AIDS if he or she develops one of the AIDS indicator illnesses defined by the Centre of Disease Control. Even HIVpositive individuals without any serious illnesses can be said to have AIDS depending on the results of certain blood tests. Studies have discovered that most individuals with HIVmay carry the virus for years before the immune system is weak enough for AIDS to develop. 

*How long does it take for HIVto cause AIDS?
It can take anywhere from between a few months to several years for AIDS to develop. This time differs for various individuals depending on factors such as a person's health position and health related activities. view wider list of FAQs on HIV/AIDS (External website that opens in a new window). 

*What is AIDS?
AIDS stands for Acquired ImmunoDeficiency Syndrome. An HIVpositive person may be given a diagnosis of AIDS if he or she develops one of the AIDS indicator illnesses defined by the Centre of Disease Control. Even HIVpositive individuals without any serious illnesses can be said to have AIDS depending on the results of certain blood tests. Studies have discovered that most individuals with HIVmay carry the virus for years before the immune system is weak enough for AIDS to develop. 

*You appear to think that Azt may be the cause of the disease in stead of a cure for it: how is that possible when the drug has been used since 1987 while the first cases of this strange immune syndrome were reported in 1981?
Between 1981 and 1984 the Centers of Disease Control in Atlanta and many independent American and English scientists have proposed that AIDS is a lifestyle disease caused by recreational drugs. See for example an editorial in the famous New England Journal of Medicine (vol. 305, p1465) by D. Durack proposing in 1981 that "recreational drugs [are] immunosuppressive". Based on the lifestyle hypothesis of the early 1980s and my own research I have proposed in IAvthat drugs cause AIDS. The drug hypothesis holds that AIDS is caused either by recreational drugs, or by DNA chain terminators such as AZT prescribed as antiHIVdrugs, or by a combination of both. Indeed, I have pointed out that DNA chain terminators like AZT are muchmore toxic than recreational drugs such as cocaine and heroin. This mayhave created the erroneous impression that the many antiHIVdrugslicensed since 1987 are the only cause of AIDS. 

*If Azt is so toxic, how is it that the incidence of infected children has decreased from 25perc. to 8perc. (in Italy and in France) in babies born to mothers who had been treated with Azt during pregnancy?
Treatment of HIVpositive, pregnant women with the DNA chain terminators has reduced the incidence of HIVin their babies from 25perc. to 8perc. in France and Italy as well as in the US. This is to be expected from a drug that was designed to kill cells including those in which HIVreplicates. AZT was developed over 30 years ago to kill cells for cancer chemotherapy. The first problem with this hypothetical triumph of antiHIVtreatment is that HIVis not the cause of AIDS. The second more serious problem that AZT induces abortion, and generates birth defects in humans and causes cancer in animals born to AZTtreated mothers. For example, a study published in 1994 found that among 104 AZT treated HIVpositive women, 8 aborted spontaneously, 8 had to be aborted "therapeutically", and 8 had babies with birth defects such as cavities in the chest, heart defects, extra fingers, misplaced ears, triangular faces, misformed spine, and albinism (Kumar et al., J. AIDS, vol. 7, p1034 (1994), cited in IAv). 

*according to our leading experts the new cocktail (protease plus transcriptase inhibitors) seems to work or at least to keep the disease at bay. How is that possible?
Contrary to the assertions of your "leading experts", the antiHIVdrug cocktails are failing in the US. A front page article of the New York Times , showing dying AIDS patients, issued a first warning in August 1997: "Despite powerful new AIDS drugs many are still losing battle (NYT, August 22, 1997). By September 1997 the American press already reported that "AIDS drug cocktails fail 53perc." (San Francisco Examiner, September 29, 1997). In view of this I wonder what your "leading experts" do to make the cocktails "work". 

*Statistics in western countries show that there are fewer deaths among people with Aids. If it is not because of the new treatment, what are the reasons?
he reasons why the AIDS epidemic is declining were given in A1, the answer to Q1. Recreational drug consumption has recently declined and therefore AIDS. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that this is due to the new AIDS drug cocktails. Such evidence would have to show, that those who still get AIDS are not treated, and those who don't get AIDS are treated. But this is not the case in the US. Practically all American AIDS patients are treated with the new drug cocktails, but they continue to die. 

*In your book you envisage a possibile role of the 'poppers' as promoters of the syndrome because of their action on the immune system. In Italy, however, only ten percent of the gay community is estimated to use poppers. How do you explain then the Aids cases among the Italian gays?
Since I do not have documentation on drug use by Italian male homosexuals, I cannot answer this question directly. Please provide a reference for your assertion that only 10perc. use poppers. However, drug use by American, English, Dutch, Canadian and Australian male homosexuals has been reported in the scientific literature: They use batteries of recreational drugs as sexual stimulants, including poppers (nitrite inhalants), amphetamines, ethyl chloride, cocaine, speed, heroin, in addition to a "polypharmacy" of medical drugs. Many of these, and particularly combinations of these drugs cause AIDS defining diseases regardless of the presence of HIV. 

*You mention studies reporting that a HIVpositive person needs an average of 1000 unprotected sexual intercourses to transmit the HIVvirus. How was it possible to establish such an average?
The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta were the first to publish in 1989 in the New England Journal of Medicine (see IAv) that it takes about 1,000 unprotected sexual contacts with an HIVpositive person to become positive. The CDC's numbers are based on thousands of "discordant" hemophilia couples, in which the husband was positive from a transfusion and some of their wives became positive over time. Recent studies on homosexual couples, other heterosexual couples and singles have confirmed the CDC's original number (see IAv). With regard to your question about the usefulness of condoms in prEventing AIDS my answer is twofold: (1) Since AIDS is caused by drugs, not by HIV, condoms do not prEvent AIDS. (2) However, since many doctors prescribe DNA chain terminators such as AZT as antiHIVdrugs to healthy HIVpositives, and since DNA chain terminators cause AIDS condoms are useful after all. They protect people who have an average of 1,000 sexual contacts with HIVpositives from infection, and thus from AIDS caused by antiHIVmedication. 

*You state that any microbe that kills all his hosts would end up by committing suicide. So what? Do you believe in a 'survival finalism' in nature, in a sort of intelligence of the virus?
Life is comparable to the law: it is based on logic and precedent. There is neither a precedent for a virus that consistently kills it's host, as is claimed for HIV, nor would it be logical for a virus to kill the host it needs for its survival. The "intelligence of a virus" killing consistently its host, would be the same as that of a car that consistently kills its drivers because it does not have brakes. 

*The WHO estimates that there are 17 million healthy seropositives in the world. You say that many thousands are discovered every year in the American Army. 'When' and 'how' were they infected and 'why' most of them don't get sick?
HIV, like all other retroviruses in animals and humans, is perinatally transmitted from mother to child. All viruses and microbes that are perinatally transmitted in nature are harmless for the reasons stated in A8. Thus those 17 million HIVpositives who are healthy, are those who do not use recreational and/or antiHIVdrugs. 

*The new tests (Pcr) can detect the virus not only its antibodies. How is it that many people die of Aids with no trace of HIVin their blood?
Contrary to your assertion, the new PCR test does not detect "the virus". Instead it detects a piece of the viral RNA or DNA genome, but not Even the complete genome. Typically any virus, whose RNA or DNA must be detected by this method, is neutralized by antibody and is thus latent, and not infectious. It is for this reason that this very expensive method was introduced to detect "the virus" in AIDS patients. It would be much cheaper, and biologically much more relevant if infectious HIVcould be detected. The difficulty in detecting infectious virus was reason for the fraud charges of the Pasteur Institute against leading AIDS researchers in the US (Gallo) and the UK (Weiss). The PCR method was invented by Kary Mullis, who wrote the foreword for IAv, to detect a needle in a haystack. But a needle in a haystack does not cause a fatal disease. This is in fact one of the fatal flaws of the HIVAIDS hypothesis. The reason why "many people die of AIDS with no trace of HIV" is simple. Since AIDS is caused by drugs, HIVmust not be present in AIDS patients this is the hallmark of a passenger virus. 

*You say that 90perc. of Aids patients are still men. In Africa the ration between men and women is 1 to 1 and in Eastern Europe, i.e. Romania, is 6 to 4. Why this difference?
This misrepresents what I state in IAv. I have stated that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization, almost 9 out of 10 AIDS patients in America and Western Europe are males. I did not say that they are "still men", because I am not a prophet, I am just a scientist. A whole chapter of IAvexplains why African AIDS is different. The African AIDS epidemic has only one thing in common with the American/European AIDS epidemic the name. African AIDS is caused by malnutrition, parasitic infection and poor sanitation. There are no risk groups in Africa, like drug addicts and homosexuals. It is for this reason that African AIDS is equally distributed between the sexes. Moreover, practically no African AIDS patients have pneumocystis pneumonia, dementia or Kaposi's sarcoma the signal diseases of AIDS in the US and Europe. Above all, African AIDS is diagnosed without Even attempting an HIVtest, which is too expensive for Africa. Thus there is no scientific evidence for the correlation between HIVand African AIDS, only guesses. 

*Has the blood screening reduced the number of infections among hemophiliacs?
This is a good question.I assume this would be so. But surprisingly neither the US nor Europe has published how HIV screening of blood supplies has affected the incidence of HIVin the American and European hemophiliacs. Please let me know if you have such publications. 

*You complain about the discrimination by the scientific community and about the grants denied by the NIH for your research on the long term effects of drugs. Has something changed after the publication of your book in the States?
The nonfunding of nonconformists has not changed in the US. Iassume it would be fatal for the current AIDS establishment if they were proven wrong, and that is why it will not change soon. 

*Is there any Italian scientist who agrees with your unorthodox views?
There are some Italian scientists who have the same questions about the unproductive HIVhypothesis as I do. For example Dr. Fabio Franchi in Trieste and Dr Raffaele Cascone in Morlupo. Others like Prof. Leonida Santamaria and Dr. Raul vergini (Predappio) have organized conferences in 1993 in Pavia and in 1994 in Bologna that have openly questioned the HIVAIDS hypothesis. 

*The best way I know to prove the HIVhypothesis wrong is to infect otherwise perfectly healthy people with HIV, don't give them any treatment, and see what happens. I know this type of research has been done with animals. Since you can't experiment on other people, why don't you infect yourself? Maybe you can recruit some followers and have a "population" for a real experiment.
I have considered, Even offered, this directly. Here are the problems: 1) In the US, it is not possible to work with HIVwithout the approval of the National Institutes of Health and the university. Thus I would need an NIH peerapproved grant to do this. Without such a contract I would risk my lab and job. 2) In addition, if 10 years after injecting myself I would still be without symptoms, the HIVAIDS orthodoxy would call me a bluff unless I had had a grant that allowed for appropriate controls. I have submitted 9 grant applications to study AIDS, including doing the study you mention, but none was approved. 3) In the US there are 1 million HIVpositive persons without any symptoms, and in the world there are an estimated 34 million. Monitoring a few hundred of these for AIDS and nonviral AIDS risks would be a statistically much more relevant experiment than if one person injected himself. But surprisingly such studies are not done. Why not?Guess! 

*How does my body protect me?
The first line of protection that your body provides against infections is your skin. Your skin acts as a barrier, and the sweat glands in it get rid of waste. An injury such as a cut provides a way for germs to enter and infect your body. The small hairs and fluids in your body openings also protect you. Nostrils have hair and mucous to keep out germs carried in the air. The saliva in your mouth contains enzymes that may destroy germs. Your eyelashes, eyelids, and tears protect your eyes. Your vagina, urethra (the tube you pee through), anus, and bowels (guts) are lined with mucous membranes, which protect them. 

*What about my immune system?
Your body's health is protected by its immune system which is a network of chemicals, cells, tissues, and organs found throughout your body.These work together to protect you from germs.Your immune system can distinguish the difference between what belongs in your body and what does not belong.When your immune system detects something foreign, it tries ti destroy and remove it to keep you healthy. White blood cells (part of the immune system) called lymphocytes (B cells and T cells) protect the body from germs such as viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungi. The two main types of Tcells are T4 (CD4) cells and T8 (CD8) cells. When a germ or virus or bacterium enters your body the immune system recognizes it as foreign to the body and potentially harmful. The T4 cells begin the attack against infections by activating killer Tcells and antibodyproducing Bcells while the T8 (CD8) cells end the immune response. Another way your immune system protects you is by the production of antibodies against what is not part of your body.The activated Bcells try to destroy any foreign particles not recognised as belonging to your body by creating antibodies to attack and destroy these foreign particles.This occurs when a virus such as HIVinfects you.Your body recognizes HIVas being foreign and potentially dangerous and therefore produces antibodies against it.Although effective at first, the antibodies do not eliminate the infection. Some HIVare killed but many more viruses will infect T4 cells, the very same cells that are supposed to coordinate the defence against the virus.Infected T4 (CD4) cells become virus factories, which if activated, will produce viruses instead of triggering the production of more antibodies against it. 

*I've heard HIVis exchanged through bodily fluids. Which ones?
HIVis present in infectious quantities in: . Blood and blood products . Semen and possibly precum . vaginal and cervical secretions . Breast milk. During invasive surgical procedures health care workers may also come into contact with the following body fluids, which contain significant amounts of HIV: . Amniotic fluid . Cerebrospinal fluid . Synovial fluid around bone joints In HIV+ persons, HIVis either not present or present in very minute amounts in: . Saliva (only found in minute amounts in a small number of people), . Tears and Blister fluid . Urine, Faeces, vomit or Sweat Finding a small amount of HIVin a body fluid does not necessarily mean that HIVcan be transmitted by that body fluid. Contact with saliva, tears, or sweat has never been shown to result in transmission of HIV. 

*Who is at risk?
You are at high risk . if you have sex without condoms . if you have many sex partners and do not use condoms . if your sex partner(s) has/have sex with other persons without using condoms. . if you have shared unsterilized needles for intravenous drug use . if you have sex with only one partner who is HIVpositive 

*How is HIVtransmitted?
The main route of HIVtransmission is through: . Unprotected sexual contact with an infected person . By sharing needles with an infected person and . From an infected mother to child during pregnancy, during birth or shortly after birth while breast feeding For HIVtransmission to occur the following criteria must be met: 1. HIVmust be present 2. There must be a sufficient quantity of HIVpresent 3. It must go into the bloodstream Note: HIVis most concentrated in blood. 

*Will a condom prEvent me from contracting HIV?
condom is the only barrier that is now available to prEvent the transmission of HIVand other sexually transmitted infections, during sexual intercourse. 

*What are the sexual routes of transmission?
Sexual intercourse (vaginal and anal): In the genitals and the rectum, HIVmay infect the mucous membranes directly or enter through cuts and sores caused during intercourse (many of which would be unnoticed). Oral sex: The mouth is an inhospitable environment for HIV(in semen, vaginal fluid or blood), meaning the risk of HIVtransmission through the throat, gums, and oral membranes is lower than through vaginal or anal membranes. There are however, documented cases where HIVwas transmitted orally, so we can't say that getting HIVinfected semen, vaginal fluid or blood in the mouth is without risk. While no one knows exactly what that risk is, cumulative evidence indicates that the risk is less than that of unprotected anal or vaginal sex. The risk from receiving oral sex, for both a man and a woman, is considered to be very low. 

*Is deep kissing a route of HIVtransmission?
Deep or openmouthed kissing is a very low risk activity in terms of HIVtransmission. There has been only one documented case of someone becoming infected with HIVthrough kissing; a result of exposure to infected blood during openmouthed kissing. If you or your partner have open wounds in your mouth, you should avoid kissing until the wound has healed. 

*What are the chances of catching HIVif the man withdrawals after sex?
Whilst research suggests that high concentrations of HIVcan sometimes be detected in precum, it is difficult to judge whether HIVis present in sufficient quantities for infection to occur. To guard against the possibility of infection with HIVor any other STI it is best to practice safer sex i.e. sex with a condom from start to finish.Note that if there is an open wound on the penis then the risk for transmission is greatly increased. Can I become infected with HIVthrough normal social contact or activities such as shaking hands, kissing, using toilet seats and swimming pools, sharing cutlery, or exposure to sneezes and coughs? 

*Is there a risk of HIVtransmission when having a tattoo, during body piercing or while visiting the barber or hairdresser?
When visiting the barber there is no risk of infection unless the skin is cut (which may occur if the barber accidentally cuts you) and if there is a transfer of infected blood. If the instruments are contaminated with infected blood and are not sterilized between clients there is a risk of HIVtransmission. To reduce the risk of bloodborne infections such as hepatitis and HIVensure that the razor/instruments used are new or have been properly sterilized. However, people who carry out body piercing, tattoos, or hairdressing should follow procedures called "universal precautions", which are designed to prEvent the transmission of bloodborne infections such as HIVand hepatitis B. 

*Am I at higher risk if I have sex with a member of the same sex?
HIVis transmitted sexually regardless of your sexual preference. Note however, that world wide there is a higher prevalence of the virus in certain groups because of their sexual practices and therefore having unsafe sex with someone from one of these groups places you at a higher risk of contracting the virus. Men who have sex with men, commercial sex workers, and people who have a sexually transmitted infection are examples of such groups. By following safe sexual practices (using a condom every time) you can reduce your chances of becoming infected. 

*How long can HIVsurvive outside the human body?
Generally the fragile nature of the virus prEvents it from surviving for a substantial amount of time in the open air. The length of time HIVcan survive outside the body is dependent on the amount of HIVpresent in the body fluid and the conditions the fluid is subjected to. Note that HIVis fragile and many common substances such as hot liquid, soap, bleach, alcohol, and the gastric juices found within your stomach can destroy the virus. The only studies on the survival of HIVoutside the body have been conducted in the laboratory under controlled scientific conditions. These studies found HIVis not affected by extreme cold, but it is inactivated by heat and is destroyed after 30 minutes at 60oC. Scientific studies have found that HIVcan sometimes survive in dried blood at room temperature for up to six days. It is extremely difficult to assess exactly the length of survival of HIVoutside the body in a non laboratory setting. 

*What are the first symptoms of HIVinfection?
The symptoms of initial HIVinfection are not very specific. Initial symptoms include a dry cough, shortness of breath and a flulike illness. During this very early period of infection only a small minority of people experience symptoms, which are serious enough to require a doctor's attention. During this stage, which is also called acute infection, the virus multiplies rapidly. You might test negative for HIVantibodies during this stage, but you can still pass HIVon to someone else. This is called the window period of roughly three months from the time of infection to the time when you will show antibodies against HIV. HIVantibodies begin to show in an infected person's blood when they seroconvert. 

*What is the Window Period?
The "window period" is the time it takes for a person who has been infected with HIVto seroconvert (test positive) for HIVantibodies. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) says about the window period: "Antibodies generally appear within three months after infection with HIV, but may take up to six months in some persons." The three month window period is normal for most of the population. Many people will have detectable antibodies in three or four weeks. very, very rarely (i.e., only a few cases ever), a person could take six months to produce antibodies. 

*Can drinking alcohol actually be beneficial to your heart?
For some people, drinking Even the smallest amount of alcohol carries major risks. For others, research shows moderate consumption may actually offer a degree of protection against heart disease. Researchers continuously are studying the relationship between alcohol consumption and the heart. And, some more recent findings suggest moderate alcohol consumption can offer some protection against heart disease for some people. But determining exactly who might benefit and who might actually be at risk is difficult. 
*What are some of the possible heartrelated benefits of moderate alcohol consumption?
Some of the possible heartrelated benefits of moderate alcohol consumption include. Raising the "good" HDL cholesterol levelLowering blood pressureInhibiting the formation of blood clots, which can be good because it may prEvent a heart attack; but, it also could increase the risk of bleeding. Helping prEvent artery damage caused by the "bad" LDL cholesterol 

*How do I know what "moderate drinking" is?
according to the American Heart Association, moderate drinking is defined as no more than one drink per day for women and no more than two drinks per day for men. One drink is qualified as 12 ounces of beer, 4 ounces of wine, 1.5 ounces of 80proof liquor, or 1 ounce of 100proof spirits. 

*Is moderate drinking safe for everyone?
No. Even moderate alcohol consumption is not right for all people. In fact, alcohol consumption can be quite harmful to some. Anyone who has had heart failure, cardiomyopathy, high blood pressure, diabetes, arrhythmia, a family history of cardiac death or stroke, obesity, high triglycerides, or are taking medications should speak to their doctor before consuming alcohol. Also, if you are pregnant or have a history of alcoholism, you should not drink alcohol. Given the potential risks created by drinking alcohol, the American Heart Association cautions people not to start drinking if they do not already drink alcohol. 

*How does alcohol affect heart disease risk?
How alcohol affects cardiovascular risk merits further research. Drinking alcohol in hopes of gaining potential health benefits is not recommended. Instead, talk to your doctor about lowering cholesterol and blood pressure, controlling weight, getting enough exercise and following a healthy diet. There is no scientific proof that drinking an alcoholic beverage can replace these conventional measures. Atrial Fibrillation 

*What is atrial fibrillation?
A heart condition that affects an estimated 2 million Americans, atrial fibrillation (AF) is rapid, irregular electrical activity in the heart's upper chambers. 

*What happens during atrial fibrillation?
Normally, your heart contracts and relaxes to a regular beat controlled by electric signals that are produced by cells within the heart. In atrial fibrillation, part of the heart beats irregularly and too fast, causing your body to not receive the proper amount of oxygen. 

*Who normally suffers from atrial fibrillation?
AF can occur in otherwise healthy people with no known heart disease, and is most often detected during stress or exercise. AF also shows up in people who've had coronary heart disease, heart attack, heart failure, heart valve disease, an inflamed heart muscle or lining, or who recently have had heart surgery. People with atherosclerosis (arteries lined with fatty deposits) and angina (chest pain) sometimes have it, and it also has been linked to congenital heart defects. AF sometimes appears in people with chronic lung disease, pulmonary blood clots, emphysema and asthma. Other factors that affect risk for AF are thyroid disorders, diabetes, high blood pressure, excessive alcohol consumption and cigarette smokingsome of which are modifiable. 

*Can atrial fibrillation cause other health problems?
AF can lead to other heart rhythm problems, chronic fatigue, heart failure and stroke. If AF is left untreated, the overactive heart muscle can weaken and stretch, making it harder for the heart's upper chambers to contract properly. Not only does this increase your risk of stroke, it also can lead to congestive heart failure. 

*What are the symptoms of atrial fibrillation?
See list below. Irregular heart beat,Heart palpitation or rapid thumping inside the chest,Dizziness, sweating and chest pain or pressure, Shortness of breath, andTiring more easily when exercising. 

*How is atrial fibrillation diagnosed?
AF most commonly is diagnosed with the help of an electrocardiogram, which allows the physician to see if your heart's electric signals are normal. 

*How is atrial fibrillation treated?
Once diagnosed, AF traditionally is treated by medication to prEvent blood clots. In some cases, surgery may be required or electric shock is used to change the beat of your heart. There is no known cure for AF, therefore the goals of treatment are to prEvent blood clots from forming, control your heart rate within a relatively normal range, and restore a normal heart rhythm, if possible. 

*What causes coronary artery disease?
Coronary artery disease is caused by atherosclerosis, the buildup of a hard, waxy substance called plaque inside your arteries.Over time, this buildup can cause narrowing inside your arteries, limiting the flow of oxygenrich blood to your heart. In some cases, pieces of plaque may break off and completely block an artery or cause an artery to clot off. 

*How does bypass surgery treat coronary artery disease?
Bypass surgery creates a detour around the blocked artery and forms an alternate route for blood to flow to the heart. 

*What happens during bypass surgery?
A piece of blood vessel is taken from somewhere else in the body and then reattached below the narrowed or blocked section of the diseased coronary artery. The earliest techniques used the saphenous veins found along the inside of the legs. Then, surgeons began using the internal mammary artery behind the left ribcage. The left internal mammary still is used more than 95 percent of the time because the mammary artery already is attached to a large artery on one end, leaving only one end of the artery to be detached and then grafted to a coronary artery. 

*What is the latest bypass surgery technique?
Over the past five to six years, cardiovascular surgeons also have been using the radial artery found in the forearm. They often start with the radial artery in the patient's nondominant arm and should another artery be needed, they then may use the right internal mammary artery in addition to the left internal mammary artery. This combination has proven to help people live longer. 

*How is bypass surgery performed?
Simply put, when bypass surgery is performed. The patient is put to sleep with general anesthesia. The surgeon exposes the heart surgically. The surgeon harvests a piece of healthy blood vessel from the chest, arm or leg.Connection to a heartlung bypass machine allows the surgeon to stop the heartbeat while he or she works on the arteries. Or, the surgeon may use newer stabilizing devices to do the bypass on the beating heart. The surgeon uses the harvested blood vessel to create bypass grafts around the narrowed or blocked parts of the arteries. The surgeon then allows flow through the bypasses and closes the incisions.The patient wakes up once the anesthesia wears off. 

*What is recovery like after bypass surgery?
Bypass surgery is a detailed procedure that varies in length depending on the complexity of each patient's problem. Recovery involves four to sEven days in the hospital, and then anywhere from three to 12 weeks of rehabilitation as the patient returns to his or her prior activities. There are no longterm restrictions and exercise, especially in the form of cardiac rehabilitation, is encouraged. Children and Exercise 

*Why should children exercise?
According to the American Heart Association, increased physical activity has been associated with increased life expectancy and decreased risk of cardiovascular disease. Children who exercise regularly improve their cardiovascular health, strengthen their heart muscles and maintain better endurance in sports. How often should children exercise? To reap benefits, children ages 2 and older should participate in at least 30 minutes of enjoyable, moderateintensity activities every day. They also should perform at least 30 minutes of vigorous physical activities such as horseplay, dancing, biking and swimminga minimum of three to four days a week. This largemuscle movement at a rapid rate helps achieve and maintain a good level of heart and lung fitness. 

*What other benefits do children gain from exercising?
Children who exercise may experience. Lungs that stay healthier longer;Less depression and stress; Reduced blood pressure;Raised HDL ("good") cholesterol; An increase in the burning of calories;A decreased risk of type I and type II diabetes; andMore self confidence and selfesteem. 

*How can I help my child like exercise?
Any form of physical activity that is regular, enjoyable and sustainable will help your child embrace exercise. The goal is to teach them to enjoy exercise while they are young so they may develop lifelong passions for activities that will keep their hearts and bodies in the best health possible. Battle of the Bulge. Fighting the Childhood Obesity Epidemic 

*Why has obesity reached epidemic proportions?
With some 30 percent of American children and adolescents overweightand half of them obeseobesity is an epidemic that is linked to lifestyle. Children are less active, do not get enough regular exercise and have unhealthy diets. 

*What health problems are overweight and obese children at risk for?
The earlier the body is exposed to such conditions, the greater the potential for organ injury and longterm health problems. Obese children are increasingly developing traditional adult diseases, such as hypertension. Historically children have experienced hypertension as a secondary condition due to kidney problems, but now it's a primary one. 

*What is hypertension?
Also known as high blood pressure, hypertension is an extremely aggressive condition that can lead to secondary organ damage targeting the eyes, heart, brain and kidneys. 

*What can parents and caregivers do to raise healthier children?
Parents and caregivers must teach healthy eating and exercise habits to their children when they are young. Healthy eating can be implemented by planning meals containing whole grains, fruit and vegetables, and eliminating fast food, sugary snacks and drinks. It also is important to control portions and to not use food as a reward, or lack of food as a punishment. Encourage daily aerobic activity by taking a family walk after dinner, playing sports together, and assigning active household or yard chores. Limiting the amount of time your children spend in front the television or computer also is essential. The Heat is On! Warming Up on Warm Weather Exercise 

*What are the benefits of regular exercise as an older adult?
Older adults benefit from regular exercise just as much as younger folks. Regular exercise slows, Even reverses, the effects of aging, benefiting you physically and psychologically. It builds strength, endurance and selfesteem, and reduces stress. Benefits include lowered risk of cardiovascular disease, higher good (HDL) cholesterol, higher bone density, weight loss or maintenance, controlled diabetes and lowered risk of osteoporosis. 

*How do you adjust to exercising in warmer weather?
It's important to adjust before summer begins. Exercise in the early morning or Evening, as these will be the coolest, most comfortable times of day. 

*What should I wear while exercising?
Wear loose, lightcolored clothing, a protective hat or visor, sunscreen and supportive shoes. Avoid long, thick pants or stockings. Do not wear darkcolored fabric, which absorbs more heat. 

*Staying hydrated is important during exercise. What signs should I look out for?
Dehydration can be a serious problem, so make sure you are hydrated throughout your day. While exercising, pay attention to signs of fatigue, such as dizziness, headaches, cramps or thirst. If you are thirsty, this is a sign that you already are dehydrated. Have a bottle of water handy while exercising. 

*What if I do not want to exercise outside? What are my options?
Try walking in malls, which are safe, flat and climatecontrolled. Or consider exercise programs and classes at your local gym, community center or hospital. 

*What is HAPI?
Palmetto Health's Healthy Aging Program Initiative (HAPI) offers a variety of group classes for all ages and ability levels, on land and in water. Classes are offered in an ongoing, fourweek long series. For more information, call 2962273 or visit www.palmettohealth.org. Cholesterol 

*Why is it important to know and manage your total cholesterol?
The risk of coronary heart disease rises as blood cholesterol levels increase. When other risk factors are present, this risk increases Even more. Cholesterol is a necessary component of our bodies, but additional dietary cholesterol is not needed. Excess cholesterol in the blood stream can form a thick, hard deposit called plaque in the artery walls. This buildup causes arteries to become thicker, harder and less flexible. When blood flow is restricted, chest pain called angina can result. When blood flow to the heart is severely restricted and a clot stops the flow completely, a heart attack results. 


*What should my total cholesterol level be?
Medical experts recommend that total cholesterol levels be less than 200 mg/dL in order for an individual to be at lower risk for heart disease. Borderline high cholesterol is 200 to 239 mg/dL; high blood cholesterol is 240 mg/dL and above. A person with this level has more than twice the risk of heart disease as someone whose cholesterol is below 200 mg/dL. 


*What's the difference in "good" versus "bad" cholesterol?
About onefourth to onethird of blood cholesterol is carried by high density lipoprotien (HDL). Often called the "good" cholesterol, high levels of HDL seem to protect against heart attack because it carries cholesterol away from the arteries and back to the liver where it is passed from the body. Optimal HDL levels are 40 mg/dL and higher. When too much lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the artery walls that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form arteryclogging plaque that can Eventually cause a heart attack or stroke. LDL cholesterol of less than 130 mg/dL is the optimal level for most people. Cholesterol Management in Your Golden Years 

*Why should cholesterol be managed in older adults?
High cholesterol levels that go untreated or unmanaged increase one's risk for coronary heart disease (CHD), which is the leading cause of death in both men and women over 65 years old and can cause longterm disability. Cholesterol treatment in highrisk individuals who are 6580 years old is beneficial and reduces the likelihood of a heart attack or other coronary heart disease Event. 

*How do you know if you are "highrisk" for coronary heart disease?
You are considered highrisk if you have known CHD. you have had a heart attack, angioplasty, bypass operation, abnormal stress test, other diagnosis of atherosclerosis or you have diabetes mellitus. 

*Am I still at highrisk if I have not had a heart attack?
You still are at highrisk, if your cholesterol level is high and you have one other major risk factor, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity or smoking. 

*What must I do to lower my cholesterol?
To lower your cholesterol, live a hearthealthy lifestyle. Eat a hearthealthy diet that includes fresh vegetables, fruit, whole grains, lowfat dairy products, and limit fatty foods. Exercise regularly, avoid smoking, control high blood pressure, manage your diabetes and maintain a healthy weight. Your doctor also may recommend cholesterollowering drugs. 

*What is the healthy range for cholesterol?
A healthy range for total cholesterol is less than 170 mg/dL and an LDL cholesterol of less than 100, or less than 70 mg/dL if you are in the highrisk category. Clinical Trials at Palmetto Health Seek to Improve Patient Care 

*What is a clinical trial?
A clinical trial is a study done with humans. The trials are designed to answer very specific questions, such as the impact of a new treatment or diagnostic test on a patient. They result in concrete information to add to the body of knowledge that exists in a particular area. They determine if something works or not. Once a drug or diagnostic treatment is approved through a clinical trial, it may take months or years before it becomes part of the standard of care. 

*What are the potential benefits of clinical trials?
Clinical trials help researchers, physicians and other medical professionals to better understand and improve patient diagnosis methods, treatments and procedures. They also provide the public access to new ways of care. 

*What should I do if I think the person with me is having a heart attack?
If you understand the "chain of survival," which includes knowing how to perform Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), you'll know where to start. You could possibly prEvent the cardiac arrest death of a loved one, friend or neighbor by knowing when to phone 911 and when to begin CPR. Early access to trained emergency responders through 911, knowing how and when to begin CPR, and getting early advanced care for a heart attack or stroke victim can save his or her life. More specifically, the American Heart Association 's adult chain of survival has four links of actions to perform should you be with an adult who becomes suddenly unresponsive. Phone 911.Begin CPR.Perform defibrillation (performed by emergency responders). Transfer to a hospital. 

*What is "CPR?"
CPR is a means of providing breathing and circulation to an unresponsive person. It is best taught in a training class. In general, the steps of CPR can be remembered as ABC. Airway. place the victim flat on his back on a hard surface and open his airway by tilting the head back with one hand while lifting up the chin with your other hand. Breathing. look, listen and feel for signs of breathing. If the victim is not breathing normally, give two slow rescue breaths. Circulation. Check for signs of response to the rescue breaths (such as normal breathing, coughing or movement). If the victim is responding but not breathing normally, continue giving rescue breaths (one breath every five seconds). If there are no signs of circulation, begin chest compressions by placing the heel of one hand on the lower part of the victim's sternum and then placing the other hand on top of the first hand. Depress the sternum 1.5 to 2 inches and perform 15 compressions to every two breaths. If the victim responds, stop the compressions. If the victim begins breathing normally, turn him onto his side and wait for rescue personnel. 
*How can I learn CPR?
Palmetto Health regularly offers CPR training courses in the basement of 1501 Sumter St. on the Palmetto Health Baptist campus. Call 2962273 for more details. Diabetes and LowCarb Diets 

*Is weight a concern if someone has diabetes?
Yes.For anyone, maintaining a healthy weight is one of the many ways to fight off heart disease. But if you have diabetes, watching your weight is Even more important because the two risk factors togetherobesity and diabetesdramatically increase your risk for heart disease. 

*How do carbohydrates affect diabetics?
For someone with diabetes who has to maintain control of high blood sugar, a carb is not just a carb. Most of the food we eat is turned into sugar for our bodies to use for energy. The pancreas produces a hormone called insulin to help the sugar get into our bodies' cells. With diabetes, your body either doesn't make enough insulin or can't use its own insulin as well as it should, or both. This causes sugars to build to high levels in your blood. One hundred percent of carbohydrates, 50 percent of proteins and 10 percent of fats are Eventually turned into sugar for our bodies to use for energy. Foods that have similar carbohydrate content can result in varying blood sugar levels when the carbohydrates are eaten without protein, fiber or fat. 

*What is the glycemic index?
The blood sugar level in a person with diabetes depends on the glycemic index (GI) and amount of the food eaten, plus the combination of carbohydrate, protein, fiber and fat eaten at the same time. When carbohydrates only are eaten during a meal or snack, the GI number of the carbohydrate has a greater influence on the blood sugar level. The glycemic index rates foods on a scale of 0 to 100. Carbs with a GI of 55 or lower (such as most fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes) tend to be slowly released into the blood and raise blood sugar gradually. Carbs with a GI of 70 or higher (including foods high in table sugar or corn syrup, white potatoes, breads or pastas, and highly processed cereals) are quickly released into the blood and raise blood sugar faster and, perhaps, higher than lowerglycemic carbs. 

*What's the best way for a diabetic to lose or maintain weight?
Typically, it is recommended that people with diabetes eat balanced meals and snacks. This helps control blood sugar levels by slowing the release of sugar into the bloodstream. When meals and snacks are balanced, those with diabetes can enjoy a wider variety of foods. However, they still must keep portion control in mind. It's wise to consult with a doctor, registered dietitian or a certified diabetes educator about the best eating plan for them. 

*Is the GI system recommended instead of a lowcarb diet for diabetics?
The GI system offers one method for diabetics to monitor their sugar intake while reaching and maintaining a healthy weight. However, it may not be the right approach for everyone and diabetics should consult with their physician before using this system.Diet and Exercise 

*How important is it to get regular exercise?
A regular exercise program benefits your health and may lessen the risk of a number of diseases, including heart disease. The heart is a muscle that needs exercise to stay in shape. Physical inactivity is a key risk factor for heart disease. Adding just a little exercise to your daily routine also reduces the risk of high blood pressure, osteoporosis, certain cancers, depression, anxiety and stress. It enhances your overall wellbeing. Regular exercise, Even walking briskly for as little as 20 to 30 minutes a day, totaling at least three hours of exercise a week, provides the following benefits. Improves circulationImproves muscle toneImproves overall body fitness Helps reduce obesity May help lower risk of agerelated disorders 

*How do you get started and what's a good exercise regimen?
Individuals should consult with their physician about safe exercise levels for their current health situation. Then, chose an exercise you enjoy that works with your lifestyle, and one that involves large muscle groups such as the legs and arms. Experts recommend a combination of aerobic and strengthtraining activities for maximum benefit. Start off exercising a minimum of three days a week, working up to five to sEven days a week. Try to exercise at least 30 minutes per day, and intensify the workout as you progress. 

*How do I make exercise part of my daily routine?
Some simple steps include the following. Use the stairs instead of the elevator Walk instead of driving if you're doing errands Take a 15minute "walk break" from work to help your heart and relieve stress Find a friend to exercise with you. This provides an incentive on the days you don't want to exercise. vary your exercise routine Set goals and reward yourself for reaching them. 

*How does regular exercise help keep LDL cholesterol levels in check?
Lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL) or the "bad" cholesterol we hear about is most dangerous when it appears as small, compact particles. Even moderate exercise like walking or gardening can help keep LDL cholesterol large and "fluffy." That's a step in the right direction. 

*What constitutes a healthy diet? Do you have to be vegetarian to be heart healthy?
Make heart healthy eating part of your daily routine. Eat a variety of foods you like in moderate amounts, choosing from all food groups, such as complex carbohydrates, proteins, fruits, vegetables, dairy and minimal fats and sugars. Eliminating or reducing red meat, refined sugar and flours, and caffeine can help point you in the right direction toward more healthy eating. Adding fiber also boosts healthy eating and has been proven to help lower blood sugar and cholesterol levels. Consider reducing your sodium intake to no more than 3,000 mg daily. And don't forget to drink at least eight 8ounce glasses of water a day to help your body's digestive functions and to curb your appetite. 

*What percent of daily calories should come from fat?
A normal diet should consist of less than 30 percent of calories from fat. The percentage is Even less20 percentfor people working to prEvent heart disease, and Even lower10 percentfor people working to reverse heart disease.Electrophysiology Studies 


*What are electrophysiology studies?
Having an irregular heartbeat can be a sign of more serious heart problems. Electricalactivity based technologycalled electrophysiology (EP) studies the electrical activity of the heart to detect the presence of irregular heart rhythms in patients and helps the physician determine necessary treatment. 

*What is an arrhythmia?
An arrhythmia is an irregular heartbeat that often results from a change or malfunction in the heart's conduction system. The conduction system is where normal electrical activity travels where normal electrical impulses travel through the heart. An arrhythmia can occur when the heart's natural pacemaker develops an abnormal rate, the normal conduction pathway is interrupted, or another part of the heart takes over as pacemaker. Arrhythmias can be unusually fast, called tachycardia, or unusually slow, called bradycardia. 

*Should I be worried if I have an arrhythmia?
Some arrhythmias are signs of a more serious problem, while others are not. The irregular heartbeat can be brief and unnoticeable, but it also can be quite bothersome or Even fatal. Because an occasional skipped heartbeat is not medically significant in the majority of cases does not mean that arrhythmias should be ignored. Notify your physician if you feel any skipped beats or feel that your heart is beating differently than normal. 

*How is an EP study performed?
At Palmetto Health Richland's Heart Hospital, EP studies are done in the EP Lab, which is part of the Catheterization Lab. The lab is equipped with the necessary monitoring devices, video display equipment and Xray cameras. Once the patient is made comfortable, heart and blood pressure monitoring begin and an intravenous line is inserted. The area where the thin tubelike catheter will enter the body is locally anesthetized. A long, thin tubelike catheter is inserted in an artery or vein in the arm, neck or groin. The catheter then is guided into the heart. Small pacemaker catheters then are inserted through the catheter. The physician sends electrical impulses through these catheters to check for problems with the heart's electrical system. Once in place, the electrode catheter performs specific, essential measurements of the heart's electrical activity and pathways. The catheter records heart sounds to assess the presence of arrhythmias. 

*What happens if an arrhythmia is detected?
If the abnormal source of an arrhythmia is detected, the physician may use the opportunity to perform treatment such as radiofrequency ablation. Radiofrequency energy from the tip of the catheter is used to heat and destroy the heart cells that are creating the arrhythmia. Some reasons for having an EP study include fainting, irregular heartbeat, and a very fast or slow heartbeat. 

*How long does an EP study take?
An EP study that includes ablation treatment can take up to six hours. 

*What happens after the EP study?
Once the procedure is concluded, the catheter is withdrawn, pressure is placed on the puncture point and the patient is watched for four to six hours before being released. The patient may go home the same day, or, occasionally, is watched overnight in the hospital. 

*How do I know if heart disease runs in my family?
Get to know your family health history by collecting information about your relatives and tracing your health history back at least three or four generations. If a parent and/or family members has heart disease or died from a heart attack, you are at risk of developing other risk factors, such as high cholesterol, obesity, high blood pressure or diabetes. 

*If I have a family history of heart disease, what should I do to reduce my risk?
visit your physician for a complete medical evaluation, lipid profile, and blood sugar and blood pressure check. Make sure he or she knows what medications or drugs you are using as well as any type of stress or other situations you may be facin 

*What is alcohol?
Ethyl alcohol, or ethanol, is an intoxicating ingredient found in beer, wine, and liquor. Alcohol is produced by the fermentation of yeast, sugars, and starches. 

*How does alcohol affect a person?
Alcohol affects every organ in the body. It is a central nervous system depressant that is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine into the bloodstream. Alcohol is metabolized in the liver by enzymes; however, the liver can only metabolize a small amount of alcohol at a time, leaving the excess alcohol to circulate throughout the body. The intensity of the effect of alcohol on the body is directly related to the amount consumed. 
*Why do some people react differently to alcohol than others?
Individual reactions to alcohol vary, and are influenced by many factors; such as: Age. Gender. Race or ethnicity. Physical condition (weight, fitness level, etc). Amount of food consumed before drinking. How quickly the alcohol was consumed. Use of drugs or prescription medicines. Family history of alcohol problems. 
*What is a standard drink in the United States?
A standard drink is equal to 13.7 grams (0.6 ounces) of pure alcohol. Generally, this amount of pure alcohol is found in 12ounces of beer. 8ounces of malt liquor. 5ounces of wine. 1.5ounces or a shot of 80proof distilled spirits or liquor (e.g., gin, rum, vodka, or whiskey). 

*Is beer or wine safer to drink than liquor?
No. One 12ounce beer has about the same amount of alcohol as one 5ounce glass of wine, or 1.5ounce shot of liquor. It is the amount of alcohol consumed that affects a person most, not the type of alcoholic drink. 

*What are caffeinated alcoholic beverages (CABs)?
Caffeinated alcoholic beverages (CABs) are premixed beverages that combine alcohol, caffeine, and other stimulants. They may be malt or distilled spiritsbased and usually have higher alcohol content than beer (e.g., 5perc.12perc. on average for CABs compared to 4perc.5perc. for beer). The caffeine content in these beverages is usually not reported. 

*What does moderate drinking mean?
There is no one definition of moderate drinking, but generally the term is used to describe a lowerrisk pattern of drinking. According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans,1 drinking in moderation is defined as having no more than 1 drink per day for women and no more than 2 drinks per day for men. This definition is referring to the amount consumed on any single day and is not intended as an average over several days. 

*Is it safe to drink alcohol and drive?
No. Alcohol use slows reaction time and impairs judgment and coordination, which are all skills needed to drive a car safely.2 The more alcohol consumed, the greater the impairment. 

*What does it mean to be above the legal limit for drinking?
The legal limit for drinking is the alcohol level above which an individual is subject to legal penalties (e.g., arrest or loss of a driver's license). Legal limits are measured using either a blood alcohol test or a breathalyzer. Legal limits are typically defined by state law, and may vary based on individual characteristics, such as age and occupation. All states in the United States have adopted 0.08perc. (80 mg/dL) as the legal limit for operating a motor vehicle for drivers aged 21 years or older. However, drivers younger than 21 are not allowed to operate a motor vehicle with any level of alcohol in their system. Note: Legal limits do not define a level below which it is safe to operate a vehicle or engage in some other activity. Impairment due to alcohol use begins to occur at levels well below the legal limit. 

*What do you mean by heavy drinking?
For men, heavy drinking is typically defined as consuming an average of more than 2 drinks per day. For women, heavy drinking is typically defined as consuming an average of more than 1 drink per day.

*What is binge drinking?
According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism binge drinking is defined as a pattern of alcohol consumption that brings the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level to 0.08perc. or more. This pattern of drinking usually corresponds to 5 or more drinks on a single occasion for men or 4 or more drinks on a single occasion for women, generally within about 2 hours.3 

*What is the difference between alcoholism and alcohol abuse?
Alcohol abuse4 is a pattern of drinking that results in harm to one's health, interpersonal relationships, or ability to work. Manifestations of alcohol abuse include the following: Failure to fulfill major responsibilities at work, school, or home. Drinking in dangerous situations, such as drinking while driving or operating machinery. Legal problems related to alcohol, such as being arrested for drinking while driving or for physically hurting someone while drunk. Continued drinking despite ongoing relationship problems that are caused or worsened by drinking. Longterm alcohol abuse can turn into alcohol dependence. Dependency on alcohol, also known as alcohol addiction and alcoholism4, is a chronic disease. The signs and symptoms of alcohol dependence include A strong craving for alcohol. Continued use despite repeated physical, psychological, or interpersonal problems. The inability to limit drinking. 

*What does it mean to get drunk?
Getting drunk or intoxicated is the result of consuming excessive amounts of alcohol. Binge drinking typically results in acute intoxication. Alcohol intoxication can be harmful for a variety of reasons, including Impaired brain function resulting in poor judgment, reduced reaction time, loss of balance and motor skills, or slurred speech. Dilation of blood vessels causing a feeling of warmth but resulting in rapid loss of body heat. Increased risk of certain cancers, stroke, and liver diseases (e.g., cirrhosis), particularly when excessive amounts of alcohol are consumed over extended periods of time. Damage to a developing fetus if consumed by pregnant women.5 Increased risk of motorvehicle traffic crashes, violence, and other injuries. Coma and death can occur if alcohol is consumed rapidly and in large amounts. 

*How do I know if I have a drinking problem?
Drinking is a problem if it causes trouble in your relationships, in school, in social activities, or in how you think and feel. If you are concerned that either you or someone in your family might have a drinking problem, consult your personal health care provider. 


*What can I do if I or someone I know has a drinking problem?
Consult your personal health care provider if you feel you or someone you know has a drinking problem. Other resources include the National Drug and Alcohol Treatment Referral Routing Service available at 1800662HELP. This service can provide you with information about treatment programs in your local community and allow you to speak with someone about alcohol 

*What health problems are associated with excessive alcohol use?
Excessive drinking both in the form of heavy drinking or binge drinking, is associated with numerous health problems, including Chronic diseases such as liver cirrhosis (damage to liver cells); pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas); various cancers, including liver, mouth, throat, larynx (the voice box), and esophagus; high blood pressure; and psychological disorders. Unintentional injuries, such as motorvehicle traffic crashes, falls, drowning, burns and firearm injuries. violence, such as child maltreatment, homicide, and suicide. Harm to a developing fetus if a woman drinks while pregnant, such as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Alcohol abuse or dependence. 

*I'm young. Is drinking bad for my health?
Yes.7, 8 Studies have shown that alcohol use by youth and young adults increases the risk of both fatal and nonfatal injuries.9, 10, 11 Research has also shown that youth who use alcohol before age 15 are five times more likely to become alcohol dependent than adults who begin drinking at age 21.12 Other consequences of youth alcohol use include increased risky sexual behaviors, poor school performance, and increased risk of suicide and homicide.13, 14, 15 

*What is Alzheimer's Disease?
Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia among older adults. Alzheimer's disease involves parts of the brain that control thought, memory, and language and can seriously affect a person's ability to carry out daily activities. Although scientists are learning more every day, right now, they still do not know what causes Alzheimer's disease. 

*Who has Alzheimer's Disease?
As many as 5 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's disease. While younger people may get Alzheimer's disease, it is much less common. The disease usually begins after age 60, and risk goes up with age. About 5 percent of men and women ages 65 to 74 have Alzheimer's disease, and nearly half of those age 85 and older may have the disease. It is important to note, however, that Alzheimer's disease is not a normal part of aging. 

*What causes Alzheimer's Disease?
Scientists do not yet fully understand what causes Alzheimer's disease. There probably is not one single cause, but several factors that affect each person differently. Age is the most important known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. The number of people with the disease doubles every 5 years beyond age 65. Family history is another risk factor. Researchers believe that genetics may play a role in developing Alzheimer's disease. 

*What Are the Symptoms of Alzheimer?
The symptoms (warning signs) of anthrax are different depending on the type of the disease: Cutaneous: The first symptom is a small sore that develops into a blister. The blister then develops into a skin ulcer with a black area in the center. The sore, blister and ulcer do not hurt. Gastrointestinal: The first symptoms are nausea, loss of appetite, bloody diarrhea, and fever, followed by bad stomach pain. Inhalation: The first symptoms of inhalation anthrax are like cold or flu symptoms and can include a sore throat, mild fever and muscle aches. Later symptoms include cough, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, tiredness and muscle aches. (Caution: Do not assume that just because a person has cold or flu symptoms that they have inhalation anthrax.) 

*How Is Anthrax Treated?
Antibiotics are used to treat all three types of anthrax. Early identification and treatment are important. PrEvention after exposure. Treatment is different for a person who is exposed to anthrax, but is not yet sick. Healthcare providers will use antibiotics (such as ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, doxycycline, or penicillin) combined with the anthrax vaccine to prEvent anthrax infection. Treatment after infection. Treatment is usually a 60day course of antibiotics. Success depends on the type of anthrax and how soon treatment begins. Can Anthrax Be PrEvented? vaccination. There is a vaccine to prEvent anthrax, but it is not yet available for the general public. Anyone who may be exposed to anthrax, including certain members of the U.S. armed forces, laboratory workers, and workers who may enter or reenter contaminated areas, may get the vaccine. Also, in the Event of an attack using anthrax as a weapon, people exposed would get the vaccine. 

*What Should I Do if I Think I Have Anthrax?
If you are showing symptoms of anthrax infection, call your healthcare provider right away. 

*What Should I Do if I Think I Have Been Exposed to Anthrax?
Contact local law enforcement immediately if you think that you may have been exposed to anthrax. This includes being exposed to a suspicious package or envelope that contains powder. 
*What Is CDC Doing To Prepare For a Possible Anthrax Attack?
CDC is working with state and local health authorities to prepare for an anthrax attack. Activities include: Developing plans and procedures to respond to an attack using anthrax. Training and equipping emergency response teams to help state and local governments control infection, gather samples, and perform tests. Educating healthcare providers, media, and the general public about what to do in the Event of an attack. Working closely with health departments, veterinarians, and laboratories to watch for suspected cases of anthrax. Developing a national electronic database to track potential cases of anthrax. Ensuring that there are enough safe laboratories for quickly testing of suspected anthrax cases. Working with hospitals, laboratories, emergency response teams, and healthcare providers to make sure they have the supplies they need in case of an attack. 

*What is anthrax?
Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by the sporeforming bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax most commonly occurs in wild and domestic mammalian species (cattle, sheep, goats, camels, antelopes, and other herbivores), but it can also occur in humans when they are exposed to infected animals or to tissue from infected animals or when anthrax spores are used as a bioterrorist weapon. Transmission 

*How is anthrax transmitted?
Anthrax is not known to spread from one person to another person. B. anthracis spores can live in the soil for many years, and humans can become infected with anthrax by handling products from infected animals or by inhaling anthrax spores from contaminated animal products. Anthrax can also be spread by eating undercooked meat from infected animals. It is rare to find infected animals in the United States. Anthrax spores can be used as a bioterrorist weapon, as was the case in 2001, when Bacillus anthracis spores had been intentionally distributed through the postal system, causing 22 cases of anthrax, including 5 deaths. 

*What are the types of anthrax infection?
Anthrax infection can occur in three forms: cutaneous (skin), inhalation, and gastrointestinal. Cutaneous: Most (about 95perc.) anthrax infections occur when the bacterium enters a cut or abrasion on the skin, such as when handling contaminated wool, hides, leather or hair products (especially goat hair) of infected animals. Skin infection begins as a raised itchy bump that resembles an insect bite but within 12 days develops into a vesicle and then a painless ulcer, usually 13 cm in diameter, with a characteristic black necrotic (dying) area in the center. Lymph glands in the adjacent area may swell. About 20perc. of untreated cases of cutaneous anthrax will result in death. Deaths are rare with appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Inhalation: Initial symptoms may resemble a common cold sore throat, mild fever, muscle aches and malaise. After several days, the symptoms may progress to severe breathing problems and shock. Inhalation anthrax is usually fatal. Gastrointestinal: The intestinal disease form of anthrax may follow the consumption of contaminated meat and is characterized by an acute inflammation of the intestinal tract. Initial signs of nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, fever are followed by abdominal pain, vomiting of blood, and severe diarrhea. Intestinal anthrax results in death in 25perc. to 60perc. of cases. 

*What are the case fatality rates for the various forms of anthrax?
Early treatment of cutaneous anthrax is usually curative, and early treatment of all forms is important for recovery. Patients with cutaneous anthrax have reported case fatality rates of 20perc. without antibiotic treatment and less than 1perc. with it. Although casefatality estimates for inhalation anthrax are based on incomplete information, the rate is extremely high, approximately 75perc., Even with all possible supportive care including appropriate antibiotics. Estimates of the impact of the delay in postexposure prophylaxis or treatment on survival are not known. For gastrointestinal anthrax, the casefatality rate is estimated to be 25perc.60perc. and the effect of early antibiotic treatment on that casefatality rate is not defined. 

*What are the symptoms for anthrax?
These symptoms can occur within 7 days of infection: Fever (temperature greater than 100 degrees F). The fever may be accompanied by chills or night sweats. Flulike symptoms. Cough, usually a nonproductive cough, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle aches Sore throat, followed by difficulty swallowing, enlarged lymph nodes, headache, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal distress, vomiting, or diarrhea A sore, especially on your face, arms or hands, that starts as a raised bump and develops into a painless ulcer with a black area in the center. See also Notice to Readers: Considerations for Distinguishing InfluenzaLike Illness from Inhalational Anthrax. 

*How can I know my cold or flu is not anthrax?
Many human illnesses begin with what are commonly referred to as flulike symptoms, such as fever and muscle aches. However, in most cases anthrax can be distinguished from the flu because the flu has additional symptoms. In previous reports of anthrax cases, early symptoms usually did not include a runny nose, which is typical of the flu and common cold. For more information, see the Signs and Symptoms Q and 

*Which antibiotics does CDC recommend for prEvention of inhalation anthrax?
In selecting an antibiotic, we will be guided by the organism's culture and sensitivity results, history of allergic reactions, age and health status factors and antibiotic availability. When no information is available about the antimicrobial susceptibility of the implicated strain of B. anthracis, initial therapy with ciprofloxacin or doxycycline is recommended for adults and children, or levofloxacin for adults. 

*If an anthrax Event occurs, should people buy and store antibiotics?
There is no need to buy or store antibiotics, and indeed, it can be detrimental to both the individual and to the community. First, only people who are exposed to anthrax should take antibiotics, and health authorities must make that determination. Second, individuals may not stockpile or store the correct antibiotics. Third, under emergency plans, the federal government can ship appropriate antibiotics from its stockpile to wherever they are needed. 

*What drugs are FDAapproved for treatment of anthrax?
Ciprofloxacin, doxycycline and penicillin are FDAapproved for the treatment of anthrax in adults and children. 

*Is there a vaccination for anthrax?
A protective vaccine has been developed for anthrax; however, it is primarily given to military personnel. vaccination is recommended only for those at high risk, such as workers in research laboratories that handle anthrax bacteria routinely. The antibiotics used in post exposure prophylaxis are very effective in prEventing anthrax disease from occurring after an exposure. 

*Is the anthrax vaccine available to the public?
A vaccine has been developed for anthrax that is protective against invasive disease, but it is currently only recommended for highrisk populations. CDC and academic partners are continuing to support the development of the next generation of anthrax vaccines. 

*Who should be vaccinated against anthrax?
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended anthrax vaccination for the following groups: Persons who work directly with the organism in the laboratory. Persons who work with imported animal hides or furs in areas where standards are insufficient to prEvent exposure to anthrax spores. Persons who handle potentially infected animal products in highincidence areas; while incidence is low in the United States, veterinarians who travel to work in other countries where incidence is higher should consider being vaccinated. Military personnel deployed to areas with high risk for exposure to the organism. For more information, see the PrEventive Therapy Q and A and the vaccination Q and 

*Can I get screened or tested to find out whether I have been exposed to anthrax?
There is no screening test for anthrax; there is no test that a doctor can do for you that says you've been exposed to or carry it. The only way exposure can be determined is through a public health investigation. Nasal swabs and environmental tests, are not tests to determine whether an individual should be treated. These kinds of tests are used only to determine the extent of exposure in a given building or workplace. 

*What is a nasal swab test?
nasal swab involves placing a swab inside the nostrils and taking a culture. The CDC and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services do not recommend the use of nasal swab testing by clinicians to determine whether a person has been exposed to Bacillus anthracis, the bacteria responsible for anthrax, or as a means of diagnosing anthrax. At best, a positive result may be interpreted only to indicate exposure; a negative result does not exclude the possibility of exposure. Also, the presence of spores in the nose does not mean that the person has inhalation anthrax. The nose naturally filters out many things that a person breathes, including bacterial spores. To have inhalation anthrax, a person must have the bacteria deep in the lungs, and also have symptoms of the disease. Another reason not to use nasal swabs is that most hospital laboratories cannot fully identify anthrax spores from nasal swabs. They are able to tell only that bacteria that resemble anthrax bacteria are present. 

*If patients are suspected of being exposed to anthrax, should they be quarantined or should other family members be tested?
Anthrax is not known to spread from one person to another person. Therefore, there is no need to quarantine individuals suspected of being exposed to anthrax or to immunize or treat contacts of persons ill with anthrax, such as household contacts, friends, or coworkers, unless they also were also exposed to the same source of infection. For more information, see the Laboratory Testing Q and 

*What is the treatment for patients with inhalation and cutaneous anthrax?
CDC made treatment recommendations for cases of inhalation and cutaneous anthrax associated with the bioterrorism attack of 2001. These recommendations can be found in the MMWR, 10/26/2001; 50(42), 909919. 

*What drugs are FDAapproved for treatment of anthrax? Ciprofloxacin, doxycycline and penicillin are FDAapproved for the treatment of anthrax in adults and children. For more information, see the Treatment Q and A and the Cutaneous Anthrax Q
Safety Issues/Mail 

*How can mail get crosscontaminated with anthrax?
CDC does not have specific studies to address this, however, crosscontamination of the mail could occur during the processing, sorting, and delivery of mail when an envelope comes in contact with an envelope, piece of equipment (e.g., an electronic sorting machine), or other surface that is contaminated with Bacillus anthracis spores. In addition, airborne spores in contaminated postal facilities before they were cleaned might play a role. 

*When there is a known incident, how can I prEvent anthrax exposure from crosscontaminated mail?
There are no scientifically proven recommendations for prEventing exposure. However, there are some commonsense steps people can take: Do not open suspicious mail Keep mail away from your face when you open it Do not blow or sniff mail or mail contents Avoid vigorous handling of mail, such as tearing or shredding Wash your hands after handling the mail Discard envelopes after opening mail. 

*What should people do when they get a letter or package with powder?
Handling of Suspicious Packages or Envelopes. Do not shake or empty the contents of any suspicious package or envelope. Do not carry the package or envelope, show it to others or allow others to examine it. Put the package or envelope von a stable surface; do not sniff, touch, taste, or look closely at it or at any contents which may have spilled. Alert others in the area about the suspicious package or envelope. Leave the area, close any doors, and take actions to prEvent others from entering the area. If possible, shut off the ventilation system. WASH hands with soap and water to prEvent spreading potentially infectious material to face or skin. Seek additional instructions for exposed or potentially exposed persons. If at work, notify a supervisor, a security officer, or a law enforcement official. If at home, contact the local law enforcement agency. If possible, create a list of persons who were in the room or area when this suspicious letter or package was recognized and a list of persons who also may have handled this package or letter. Give this list to both the local public health authorities and law enforcement officials. .These recommendations were published on October 26, 2001, in Update: Investigation of bioterrorismrelated anthrax and interim guidelines for exposure management and antimicrobial therapy MMWR 2001; 50(42):909919. 

*What is the risk for getting anthrax from handling my own mail?
If there is a risk for inhalation anthrax associated with exposure to crosscontaminated mail, it is very low. For example, about 85 million pieces of mail were processed on the few days in 2001 after envelopes containing Bacillus anthracis (addressed to two U.S. senators) passed through the New Jersey and District of Columbia sorting facilities until they were closed. Despite the fact that both of these facilities had evidence of widespread environmental contamination with B. anthracisspores and the fact that public health officials had been aggressively looking for anthrax cases, no new cases of anthrax were identified during that time. 

*When the possibility of crosscontamination of the mail exists, should I take antibiotics?
PrEventive antibiotics are not recommended for persons who routinely open or handle mail, either at home or at the workplace. Antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommended only in certain specific situations such as for persons exposed to an air space known to be contaminated with aerosolized Bacillus anthracis or for persons in a postal sorting facility in which an envelope containing B. anthracis spores was processed. CDC's complete recommendations on antimicrobial prophylaxis are contained in the November 9, 2001 MMWR. Additional recommendations for use of vaccine as part of postexposure prophylaxis are contained in the November 15, 2002 MMWR 51(45):10241026. 

*What kinds of anthrax worker safety guidelines have been issued?
The recommendations are divided into four categories. They are engineering controls, administrative controls, housekeeping controls, and personal protective equipment for workers. The guidelines describe measures that should be implemented in mailhandling/processing sites to prEvent potential exposures to B. anthracis spores. 
*What are HIVand AIDS?
AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) is the late stage of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). AIDS can take more than 810 years to develop after infection with HIV. HIVinfected people can live symptomfree lives for years; however most people in developing countries die within three years of being diagnosed with AIDS. 

*How do people get infected with HIV?
HIVis transmitted mostly through semen and vaginal fluids during unprotected sex without the use of condoms. Globally, most cases of sexual transmission involve men and women, although in some developed countries homosexual activity remains the primary mode. Besides sexual intercourse, HIVcan also be transmitted during drug injection by the sharing of needles contaminated with infected blood; by the transfusion of infected blood or blood products; and from an infected woman to her baby before birth, during birth or just after delivery. HIVis not spread through ordinary social contact; for example by shaking hands, travelling in the same bus, eating from the same utensils, by hugging or kissing. Mosquitoes and insects do not spread the virus nor is it waterborne or airborne. 

*How many people are affected with HIV?
According to WHO estimates, by end1996, nearly 30 million people including over 2.5 million children had been infected with HIVsince the start of the pandemic. Every day, more than 7000 adults and 500 babies are infected. More than 8 million people have developed AIDS. 


*Does AIDS also affect our region?
Of the 26.8 million adults with HIVinfection the global estimate in end 1996 14 million were in SubSaharan Africa and more than 3.5 million in Asia. Our region, that is SouthEast Asia, is likely to suffer the brunt of the pandemic being home to over half the world's population. Moreover, HIV/AIDS is now present in every continent and in every region of the world. 

*Why is the AIDS epidemic considered so serious?
AIDS affects people primarily when they are most productive and leads to premature death thereby severely affecting the socioeconomic structure of whole families, communities and countries. Besides, AIDS is not curable and since HIVis transmitted predominantly through sexual contact, and with sexual practices being essentially a private domain, these issues are difficult to address 
*How can I avoid being infected through sex?
You can avoid HIVinfection by abstaining from sex, by having a mutually faithful monogamous sexual relationship with an uninfected partner or by practicing safer sex. Safer sex involves the correct use of a condom during each sexual encounter and also includes nonpenetrative sex. 

*Can we assume responsibility in prEventing HIVinfection?
Both men and women share the responsibility for avoiding behaviour that might lead to HIVinfection. Equally, they also share the right to refuse sex and assume responsibility for ensuring safe sex. In many societies, however, men have much more control than women over when, with whom and how they have sex. In such cases, men need to assume greater responsibility for their actions. 

*Does the presence of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) facilitate HIVtransmission?
Yes. Every STD causes some damage to the genital skin and mucous layer, which facilitates the entry of HIVinto the body. The most dangerous are. Syphilis Chancroid genital herpes Gonorrhoea 

*Why is early treatment of STD important?
High rates of STD caused by unprotected sexual activity enhance the transmission risk in the general population. Early treatment of STD reduces the risk of spread to other sexual partners and also reduces the risk of contracting HIVfrom infected partners. Besides, early treatment of STD also prEvents infertility and ectopic pregnancies. 

*How can children and young people be protected from HIV?
Children and adolescents have the right to know how to avoid HIVinfection before they become sexually active. As some young people will have sex at an early age, they should know about condoms and where they are available. Parents and schools share the responsibility of ensuring that children understand how to avoid HIVinfection, and learn the importance of tolerant, compassionate and nondiscriminatory attitudes towards people living with HIV/AIDS. 
*How does a mother transmit HIVto her unborn child?
An HIVinfected mother can infect the child in her womb through her blood. The baby is more at risk if the mother has been recently infected or is in a later stage of AIDS. Transmission can also occur at the time of birth when the baby is exposed to the mother's blood and to some extent transmission can occur through breast milk. Transmission from an infected mother to her baby occurs in about 30perc. of cases. 

*Can HIVbe transmitted through breastfeeding?
Yes. The virus has been found in breast milk in low concentrations and studies have shown that children of HIVinfected mothers can get HIVinfection through breast milk. Breast milk, however, has many substances in it that protect an infant's health and the benefits of breastfeeding for both mother and child are well recognized. The slight risk of an infant becoming infected with HIVthrough breastfeeding is therefore thought to be outweighed by the benefits of breastfeeding 

*Can blood transfusions transmit HIVinfection?
Yes. If the blood contains HIV. In many places blood is now screened for HIVbefore it is transfused. If you need a transfusion, try to ensure that screened blood is used. You can reduce the chances of needing a blood transfusion by taking ordinary precautions against serious injury for example, by driving carefully, insisting on wearing a seat belt, and avoiding alcohol. 
*Can injections transmit HIVinfection?
Yes. If the injecting equipment is contaminated with blood containing HIV. Avoid injections unless absolutely necessary. If you must have an injection, make sure the needle and syringe come straight from a sterile package or have been sterilized properly; a needle and syringe that has been cleaned and then boiled for 20 minutes is ready for reuse. Finally, if you inject drugs, of whatever kind, never use anyone else's injecting equipment. 

*What about having a tattoo or your ears pierced?
Tattooing, ear piercing, acupuncture and some kinds of dental work all involve instruments that must be sterile to avoid infection. In general, you should refrain from any procedure where the skin is pierced, unless absolutely necessary. 

*How serious is the interaction between HIVand TB in SouthEast Asia?
Tuberculosis kills nearly 3 million people globally, of whom nearly 50perc. are Asians. The rapid spread of HIVin the region has further complicated the already serious situation. Not only is TB the commonest lifethreatening opportunistic infection among patients living with AIDS, but the incidence of TB has now begun to increase, particularly in areas where HIVseroprevalence is high. Multidrug resistant TB is also quite common in many areas. 

*What efforts are being made to integrate HIV/AIDS/STD prEvention and control activities into primary health care?
Integration into primary health care is a priority because it is necessary for ensuring sustainability. Two examples of an integrated approach are the implementation of HIV/AIDS care and STD prEvention and control. For example, a continuum of HIV/AIDS care is being promoted as part of primary health care, with linkages to be established between institutional, community and home levels. In the area of STD prEvention and control, a syndromic approach to STD diagnosis is most suitable in the developing world as it does not require laboratory tests, and treatment can be given at the first contact with health services. WHO strongly advocates that all primary health care workers be trained in the syndromic approach to STD management. 

*Is there a vaccine for HIV/AIDS?
While there is currently no vaccine for HIV/AIDS, research is under way. Sixteen candidate vaccines are presently undergoing either phase I or phase II clinical trials in various countries, including Thailand in SouthEast Asia. These will be followed by field trials in the community to determine efficacy, which is a time consuming process and will take another 35 years or more. Hence, a vaccine for general use is unlikely to be available in the near future. WHO's role is to assist in the development, evaluation and availability of vaccines. WHO has helped four countries Brazil, Rwanda, Thailand and Uganda to prepare a comprehensive plan for HIVvaccine research including strengthening of national epidemiological, laboratory and sociobehavioural research capabilities 


*Is there a treatment for HIV/AIDS?
All the currently licensed antiretroviral drugs, namely AZT, dd1 and ddC, have effects which last only for a limited duration. In addition, these drugs are very expensive and have severe adverse reactions while the virus tends to develop resistance rather quickly with singledrug therapy. The emphasis is now on giving a combination of drugs including newer drugs called protease inhibitors; but this makes treatment Even more expensive. WHO's present policy does not recommend antiviral drugs but instead advocates strengthening of clinical management for HIVassociated opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis and diarrhoea. Better care programmes have been shown to prolong survival and improve the quality of life of people living with HIV/AIDS 


*How should governments share responsibility?
Governments are responsible for ensuring that enough resources are allocated to AIDS prEvention and care programmes, that all individuals and groups in society have access to these programmes, and that laws, policies and practices do not discriminate against people living with HIV/AIDS. Governments of developed countries have a moral responsibility to share the AIDS burden of developing countries 

*Do people living with HIV/AIDS have special rights or responsibilities?
Since everyone is entitled to fundamental human rights without discrimination, people living with HIV/AIDS have the same rights as seronegative people to education, employment, health, travel, marriage, procreation, privacy, social security, scientific benefits, asylum, etc. Seronegative and seropositive people share responsibility for avoiding HIVinfection/reinfection. But many people, including women, children and teenagers, cannot negotiate safe sex because of their low status in society or lack of personal power. Therefore men, whether knowingly infected or unaware of their HIVstatus, have a special responsibility of not putting others at risk 

*Where did AIDS come from?
AIDS is caused by a virus called HIV, but where this virus came from is not known. However, as new facts are discovered about viruses like HIV, the question of where HIVfirst came from is becoming more complicated to answer. Moreover, such questions are no longer relevant and do not help in our efforts to combat this epidemic. What is more important is the fact that HIVis present in all countries and we need to determine how best to prEvent the further spread of this deadly virus 

*Where was AIDS found?
AIDS was first recognized in the United States in 1981. However, it is clear that AIDS cases had occurred in several parts of the world before 1981. Evidence now suggests that the AIDS epidemic began at roughly the same time in several parts of the world, including the U.S. 

*But how can there suddenly be a disease that never existed before?
If we look at AIDS as a worldwide pandemic, it appears as if it is something new and rather sudden. But if we look at AIDS as a disease and at the virus that causes it, we get a different picture. We find that both the disease and the virus are not new. They were there well before the epidemic occurred. We know that viruses sometimes change. A virus that was once harmless to humans can change and become harmful. This is probably what happened with HIVlong before the AIDS epidemic. What is new is the rapid spread of the virus. It may be compared with a weed that someone brings home from a distant place. In its original environment the weed survives but does not spread much. However, once it takes root in the new environment, conditions may allow it to grow much better than it did before. It spreads, chokes out other plants, and becomes a nuisance. The spread of HIVis somewhat similar. Researchers believe that the virus was present in isolated population groups years before the epidemic began. Then the situation changed; people moved more often and travelled more; they settled in big cities; and lifestyles changed, including patterns of sexual behaviour. It became easier for HIVto spread through sexual intercourse and contaminated blood. As the virus spread, the disease which was already in existence became a new epidemic. 

*Are women at equal risk of getting infected with HIV?
Women are in fact more at risk of getting infected because of their increased vulnerability. In addition, their low status within the family and society further heighten their vulnerability to infection. It is therefore most important that every woman has access to information about HIV/AIDS to protect herself. 

*Does AIDS affect children?
Yes. Children can be both infected and affected by AIDS. Over 2.5 million children worldwide are now infected with HIV. If HIVcontinues to spread in countries, there will be a great increase in deaths among infants and children. It is also estimated that by the year 2000, 10 million children will have been orphaned as their parents die of AIDS 

*Who should provide care to HIV/AIDS affected persons?
Everyone in contact with an HIV/AIDS person is a potential care provider. In particular, this includes health care workers at various levels of the health care delivery system, social workers and counsellors, and close family members who are important care providers at home. Care basically involves clinical management, nursing care, counselling and social support 

*What role do NGOs play in AIDS control?
NGOs have an important and very special role to play. The close interpersonal interaction that NGOs have with people in the communities they work in is extremely useful for implementing the behavioural interventions necessary for HIV/AIDS prEvention and care.NGOs are also not under the same political constraints as government programmes are. They therefore have greater flexibility and the capacity to accommodate changing programmes and public needs and can innovate and implement new initiatives more easily 

*Is it safe to work with someone infected with HIV?
Yes. Most workers face no risk of getting the virus while doing their work. If they have the virus themselves, they are not a risk to others during the course of their work. 

*Why are people safe from HIVinfection during work?
As explained already, in adults, the virus is mainly transmitted through the transfer of blood or sexual fluids. Since contact with blood or sexual fluids is not part of most people's work, most workers are safe. 

*What about working every day in close physical contact with an infected person?
There are no risks involved. You may share the same telephone with other people in your office or work side by side in a crowded factory with other HIVinfected persons, Even share the same cup of tea, but this will not expose you to the risk of contracting the infection. Being in contact with dirt and sweat will also not give you the infection. 

*If a worker has HIVinfection, should he or she be allowed to continue work?
Workers with HIVinfection who are still healthy should be treated in the same way as any other worker. Those with AIDS or AIDSrelated illnesses should be treated in the same way as any other worker who is ill. Infection with HIVis not a reason in itself for termination of employment 

*Why should young people be concerned about HIV/AIDS?
The reasons for the important role of young people depend upon several factors. A major proportion of HIVinfection occurs in young people. Young people are at a high risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections, including HIVif they experiment with sex as a part of their growing up. Young people can communicate better with other young people than older people can. This means their role as peer educators and motivators can not be taken by other people. Young people have the enthusiasm, energy and idealism that can be harnessed for spreading the message of HIV/AIDS awareness and responsible sexual behaviour. Young persons can spread the message not only to their peers and to younger children, but also to their families and the community. Young persons can ideally serve as role models for younger children and their peers. 

*What can young people do about HIVand AIDS?
Young people have a vital role in the prEvention and control of HIVinfection. Their role extends from protecting themselves, protecting their peers to protecting their families and their community. First of all young people should make it a point to learn as much as possible about HIV/AIDS. They must know how the disease spreads and, more importantly how it does not spread. They must push their teachers and other role models to tell them more about HIV/AIDS and to discuss the prEvention openly and exhaustively. They must discuss aspects of HIV/AIDS and sexuality openly with their peers. They must spread the message of responsible sexual behaviour amongst their friends, community and, if possible, their family. They must set an example of responsible sexual behaviour for their peers and for younger persons. They must encourage the prompt and correct treatment of STIs, from an appropriate care provider such as a doctor. They should encourage and help in voluntary donation of blood to a certified blood bank 

*What is the difference between AIDS and HIV?
HIVis the virus that causes the disease AIDS. AIDS is the group of illnesses acquired when the immune system is unable to defend against infection. AIDS is the terminal stage of infection by the HIV. In the early stages of HIVinfection, infected person look and feel totally well. Only when the immune system gets impaired do they begin to feel ill. The time between infection with HIVand becoming ill with AIDS may range from 210 years or Even longer. 

*Can donating blood put you at risk of HIVinfection ?
When you donate blood, blood is removed from your body not put into it. Remember you cannot get the HIVunless infected blood enters your body. You can easily avoid this by ensuring that only disposable needles and Ivsets are used during blood donation 

*What is Window period' ?
The blood test to detect HIVin the body (ELISA TEST) doesn't become positive immediately after the entry of virus into the body. It takes between 13 months (maximum 6 months) for this test to become positive. This time between entry of virus into the body and the blood test becoming positive is known as 'Window period'. The person is infectious i.e. able to transmit the virus during window period. 

*Can I get AIDS virus in a barbershop ?
Chances of getting infected with HIVin a barber's shop are extremely rare. However, it is best to ensure that the barber uses a new blade while shaving you. Also make sure all his equipment scissors, razors etc. are clean and dry before he uses them 

*Can I share a toilet with someone who has AIDS ?
A Definitely. You cannot get and HIVinfection from a toilet, public or private, clean or dirty. The AIDS virus cannot survive outside the bodily fluids or in the hope for very long. 
*Can I get the AIDS virus through kissing ?
While dry kissing in which there is no exchange of body fluids is safe, there is some risk of HIVinfection being transmitted through deep kissing particularly if some has got bleeding gums or cuts and sores in the mouth. 

*Can I get HIVfrom a mosquito bite ?
No, it is not possible to get HIVfrom mosquitoes. While sucking blood from someone mosquitoes do not inject blood from any previous person. The only thing that mosquito injects is saliva, which act as a lubricant and enables it to feed more efficiently.

*Can I become infected with HIVthrough biting ?
Infection with HIVin this way is unusual. There have only been couple of documented cases of HIVtransmission resulting from biting. In these particular cases severe tissue tearing and damage were reported in addition to the presence of blood.

*What doctor treats AarskogScott syndrome ?
AarskogScott syndrome is a genetic defect that may become evident at different stages of life. Multiple specialities are involved. A pediatrician may turn suspicious with a child born with congenital anomalies like heart defects or a cleft palate. Sometimes, a diagnosis results when there is a detailed search into the cause of short stature, undescended testes, and other physical abnormalities. A team of specialist including a physician specialized in Internal Medicine, surgeon and dentist may all be involved in the treatment of this condition.

*Can AarskogScott syndrome be prevented?
No. AarskogScott syndrome is an inherited genetic disease that arises due to mutations. However, we can take protective steps like prevention of consanguineous marriages (marriage between close blood related family members). 

*Is there a role for genetic counselling in preventing AarskogScott syndrome?
Yes. Genetic counselling is indicated for individuals or families who carry AarskogScott syndrome.

*Which doctor should I visit in case I wish to undergo an abortion?
You should visit your gynecologist or a doctor trained and competent enough to conduct an abortion.

*Which is better  medical abortion or surgical abortion?
The choice between medical abortion and surgical abortion depends on the duration of pregnancy and individual preference. Surgical abortion can be done in a single visit, while medical abortion requires multiple visits. On the other hand, the usual risks of surgery can be avoided with medical abortion.

*How do I know that the fetus is completely aborted after a medical abortion?
You will need to visit your doctor, who will examine you and make sure that the fetus is completely aborted. 

*Which specialist should I see if I have Acute Bronchitis?
You should consult a General Physician or a Pulmonologist.

*How do people get acute bronchitis?
Acute bronchitis spreads from person to person through cough droplets. The viruses that cause the infection are sprayed into the air or onto people's hands when they cough. You can catch acute bronchitis if you breathe in these viruses or touch hands coated with these viruses. Cigarette smoking or being exposed to industrial fumes can break down the body's defense against infection. People who smoke are more likely to get acute bronchitis and have it for a longer period.

*What are the other problems that occur along with acute bronchitis?
 Sometimes the cough from acute bronchitis lasts for several weeks. Usually this happens because the bronchial tubes may take a long time to heal. Acute bronchitis can be confused with asthma. If you continue to wheeze and cough, especially at night or when you are active, you could have mild asthma. 

*Who is the doctor who treats ALL(Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia)?
A hematologist or an oncologist (cancer specialist) may treat ALL. A pediatric oncologist may treat ALL in children.

*What kind of diet is recommended for ALL patients?
All foods must be cooked. Fresh fruits or vegetables must be avoided. Meats should be cooked until well done.

*What are the other precautions to be taken(Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia)?
While being treated, the patient should avoid exposure to crowds. They should avoid contact with people who have contagious illnesses, especially those with viral infections like flu, measles and Chicken Pox. Strenuous activity must be avoided.

*What are the long-term effects of radiation?
 the long run, radiation can cause cataract, sterility, lung, kidney and bone marrow problems. Cancers may also occur, especially leukemia, breast, brain, thyroid and lung cancer.

*How does potassium iodide help in radiation (Acute Radiation Syndrome)?
Potassium iodide gets concentrated in the thyroid gland and prevents accumulation of radioactive iodine in the thyroid gland, which could lead to thyroid cancer in the long run.

*How is internal contamination treated Acute Radiation Syndrome?
In some cases, internal contamination of the digestive tract may be reduced with stomach wash and drugs that cause vomiting or laxatives. Antacids like aluminum phosphate gel may reduce the absorption of radioactive strontium.
Water may be used as a diluting agent to dilute the levels of radioactive tritium (*) in the body.

*What is depression?
Depression is more than the blues or the blahs; it is more than the normal, everyday ups and downs. Clinical depression is a serious health problem that affects the total person. In addition to feelings, it can change behavior, physical health and appearance, academic performance, social activity and the ability to handle everyday decisions and pressures. 

*What causes clinical depression?
We do not yet know all the causes of depression, but there seem to be biological and emotional factors that may increase the likelihood of an individual developing a depressive disorder.

*How common Adolescent Depression?
Clinical depression is a lot more common than what most people think. One-fourth of all women and one-eighth of all men will suffer at least one episode of depression during their lifetime. Depression affects people of all ages but is less common for teenagers than for adults.  

*Adolescent Depression serious?
Depression can be very serious. It has been linked to poor school performance, truancy, alcohol and drug abuse, running away, and feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness. In the past *years, the rate of suicide among teenagers and young adults has increased dramatically. Suicide is often linked to depression. 

*Are all depressive disorders alike?
There are various forms or types of depression. Some people experience only one episode of depression in their whole life, but many have several recurrences. Some depressive episodes begin suddenly for no apparent reason, while others can be associated with a life situation or stress. Some people suffer from bipolar disorder in which their moods cycle between two extremes-from the depths of desperation to frenzied talking or activity or grandiose ideas about their own competence. 

*Can Adolescent Depression treated?
 Yes, depression is treatable. Between *and *percent of people with depression-even the most serious forms-can be treated. There are a variety of antidepressant medications and psychotherapies that can be used to treat depressive disorders. Some people with milder forms may do well with psychotherapy alone

*Which is more common-the dry form or the wet form Age Related Macular Degeneration?
The dry form of AMD is much more common than the wet form. 

*Can the dry form turn into the wet form Age Related Macular Degeneration?
Yes, there are high chances of a dry form of AMD progressing to wet AMD. Amsler grid test is a very useful test to detect early changes or deterioration in vision. It is a square grid of small squares with a central black dot. The patient needs to concentrate on the central dot with one eye and see if he visualizes any distortions or black spot.

*If I have been diagnosed with early AMD, should I take the nutrients to help prevent disease progression to the intermediate stage?
AREDS study has shown no role of nutrient supplements in early cases of AMD. However, if a patient has been diagnosed as early AMD, a dilated fundus examination by an eye doctor can help detect progression. A regular amsler grid test can also detect early changes in vision.

*Which doctor do I need to consult for Agoraphobia?
 It would be necessary to consult a Psychiatrist.

*What are the causes of Agoraphobia?
here is no known definitive cause for Agoraphobia. There are many theories that suggest that it could be caused due to of a number of physical and environmental factors.

*Are there any specific tests for Agoraphobia?
 No, the doctor makes the diagnosis solely on the information given by the patient. The doctor would make the diagnosis after carefully evaluating the patient to make sure there are no signs of other mental or physical disorders.

*Can a person suffer from agoraphobia without having any history of panic attacks? 
Yes. About *of people with agoraphobia do not experience panic attacks.

*Are parents any way responsible in making a child more prone to agoraphobia? 
There are no conclusive results, but many studies suggest that some individuals who suffer from panic disorder and agoraphobia have had a history of overprotective families.

*What is the course of Agoraphobia with treatment?
 The prognosis is actually very good, with proper medication and psychotherapy, *of patients will find significant improvement in their symptoms and condition.

*How does one lower the risk of becoming agoraphobic?
 Generally it may not be possible to prevent agoraphobia.

*Which doctors treat AIDS cancers?
A physician experienced in treating AIDS patients normally deals with anti  HIV drug treatment. Beside this, AIDS cancer may also be treated by a surgeon or a specialist depending on the organ involved.

*Are AIDS defining cancers seen only in AIDS patients?
Kaposis sarcoma is usually seen in AIDS patients. The other AIDS defining cancers however may be seen in non-AIDS patients as well.

*Do all AIDS patients die of cancer?
No. AIDS patients could die due to infections, liver disease and heart disease among other causes.

*What is the difference between HIV and AIDS?
HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. When a person is infected with the HIV virus, he is said to be HIV positive. The HIV virus continues to grow in the patient and finally reduces his immunity, making him susceptible to certain infections and cancers. This stage is called AIDS. 

*What are the main routes of HIV transmission?
 The main routes of HIV transmission are:
Unprotected penetrative intercourse with someone who is infected.
Injection or transfusion of contaminated blood or blood products taken from someone who is infected.

*Is there any association between HIV and other STDs?
 Existence of STDs has an impact upon HIV/AIDS infection. The presence of STDs can increase the risk of HIV transmission.

*Can I get HIV from a mosquito?
 No it is not possible to get HIV from mosquitoes. When taking blood from someone mosquitoes do not inject blood from previous person.

*Can HIV virus be transmitted outside of the body?
  HIV virus may live for some time outside of the body, but scientists agree that HIV does not survive well in the environment, making the possibility of environmental transmission remote.


*Which doctor should I ideally see if I am suffering from albinism?
 You should see an ophthalmologist and a dermatologist.

*Are there any developmental problems associated with ocular albinism?
 Usually there are no developmental problems associated with ocular albinism but in rare occasions when there is a chromosomal deletion within the gene it can result in deafness, developmental retardation, and mildly shortened stature.

*Who is at risk of albinism?

 Albinism is a hereditary disorder and hence the following people are at a higher risk of developing the disease-
Children of parents who have albinism.

*What are the chances that an individual is affected by albinism?
The albinism gene is recessive and hence does not cause albinism unless a person inherits two copies of the gene for albinism in other words if there is no gene that makes the normal pigment. 

*What is the prognosis of albinism?
Albinism does not usually affect the lifespan. However, the lifespan can be shortened in the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome due to lung disease or bleeding problems. People with albinism may have to limit their activities because they cannot tolerate sun exposure.

*Which specialist should I see if I am suffering from Alcoholic liver disease?
You should consult a General Physician or a General surgeon. 

*Who are more susceptible to alcoholic liver disease? 
 Women may be more susceptible than men. Alcoholic liver disease may not affect all heavy drinkers. In some people, the rate of alcohol metabolism can be high enough to allow for the consumption of large quantities of alcohol without raising the alcohol level in blood . 

*How does alcohol cause Cirrhosis of liver?
Ethanol in alcohol causes inflammation of the liver cells (hepatitis). This can progress to a "fatty liver" where there is abnormal collection of fat, and this can eventually lead to cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is the final phase of the disease. 

*Which specialist should I consult for Alzheimer's Disease?

Anyone can get a boil. However, people with certain illnesses are more likely to develop boils. Among these illnesses are diabetes and kidney failure. Diseases that are associated with deficiencies in the normal immune system can increase the tendency to develop boils. 

What can be done to prevent abscesses?
There are some measures that you can take to prevent abscesses from forming. Antibacterial soaps may help prevent bacteria build up on the skin and therefore reduce the chance for an abscess to form. In some cases, the doctor may recommend special cleansers to further reduce the bacteria on the skin. 


*Who does a bone marrow biopsy?

A bone marrow biopsy is usually done by a hematologist, oncologist, or pathologist, or by a specially-trained technician.

*What are the factors that affect the results of bone marrow biopsy test?
Factors that affect the results of bone marrow biopsy test include-
A recent blood transfusion 
Treatment with medications that contain iron 
Rough handling, contamination, or inadequate refrigeration of the bone marrow sample 
Previous radiation treatment to the site where the bone marrow sample is removed. 

*What are the new bone marrow biopsy needles and procedures used to minimize pain? 
Recently, specimen capturing bone marrow biopsy needles have been introduced to minimize the pain resulting from manipulations of the bone marrow needle and to help your doctor ensure recovery of adequate specimens.
The SNARECOILTM bone marrow biopsy needle is a specimen capturing needle that incorporates a tiny internal snare mechanism that coils around the tip of the specimen after it has entered the needle and thereby captures it. 
This mechanism eliminates the need to significantly move the needle after it has been advanced into the bone marrow tissue to recover the specimen. This advantage is relevant not only for the patient who may require a single bone marrow biopsy for diagnosis but especially for those patients with blood cancers such as leukemia or lymphoma, who may require multiple procedures to evaluate the efficacy of their treatments.


*Which doctors do bone marrow transplantation?
Bone marrow transplantation is performed by physicians including oncologists specialized in doing the transplantation.

*Should I ask my doctor to preserve my babys umbilical cord once she is born?
Preserving the umbilical cord after the baby is born is definitely a good option.
However, the high cost for storage in private cord banks could definitely be a deterrent. The umbilical cord could also be stored in public banks; however, public banks do not assure the same stem cells will be provided to the person or family when required.

*Where can I find donors for bone marrow transplantation?
Siblings or close relatives are preferred for bone marrow transplantation. If they are not available, donors may also be found in national and international bone marrow registries.

*What complications could I have as a donor?
Marrow donors may suffer from complications like pain and discomfort at the site of injection. Donors administered growth factors prior to harvesting could sometimes undergo complications like bone pain and splenic rupture. 

*What is the cost of bone marrow transplantation? 
The cost for bone marrow transplant may vary for each patient depending on the type of transplant. 

*Whom should I go to have a Botox treatment done?
You should go to a cosmetologist or a plastic surgeon to get this treatment done.

*Is Botox safe?
If the treatment is carried out by a trained professional in medical settings, then it is quite safe.

*Why is Botox treatment costly?
It is costly because it involves experts from various different specialties.

*Which specialist should I consult if I have an enlarged prostate gland?
You should seek an appointment with an Urologist, a doctor who specializes in problems of the urinary tract and the male reproductive system.

*What are the complications of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia?
Complications of BPH include-
 Urine retention
 Strain on the bladder
 Bladder stones
 Urinary Tract Infections (UTI)
 Bladder or Kidney damage
 Incontinence
 Retrograde ejaculation- If during surgery the muscle that is involved in ejaculation may be cut, semen may travel backward into the bladder during an orgasm, instead of traveling out of the body through the urethra.
 Infection
 Excessive bleeding
 Impotence. 

*Who treats bradycardia ?
The cardiologist is the specialist who treats bradycardia 

*How does your heart beat ?
The heart beat is initiated normally by an electrical discharge from the sinoatrial node or the SA node. The atria and ventricles depolarise sequentially as electrical depolarisation passes through the specialised conducting tissues.

*How is heart rate regulated?
The sinus node acts as a pacemaker and its intrinsic rate is regulated by the autonomic nervous system. Thus vagal activity slows the heart rate and sympathetic activity accelerates it via the cardiac sympathetic nerves and circulating catecholamines.
The subsidiary pacemakers in the Atrioventricular node, specialized conducting system and muscle initiate activation if the SA node is dysfunctional or suppressed. 
The subsidiary pacemakers discharge at a slower rate and in the absence of an appropriate increase in stroke volume, may result in tissue hypoperfusion. 

*What is an arrhythmia?
Disturbance in the electrical rhythm of the heart is called arrhythmia.

*When do arrhythmias occur?
Arrhythmias can occur in a normal heart or when there is structural heart disease.

*What are the symptoms of arrhythmia?
Symptoms occur with extremes of heart rate. Symptoms include palpitation, dizziness, syncope, chest discomfort, breathlessness and can cause heart failure and sudden death.


*What are the causes of brain tumor?
The ultimate cause of brain tumor is not known but various factor such as radiation exposure and poly vinyl chloride increases the chance of developing brain tumor. 

*Is it inherited from one generation to the other?
No, it is not inherited. But individuals with family history of gliomas are likely to develop brain tumors. 

*Is surgery necessary for brain cancer?
Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for malignant and benign carcinoma of the brain. The success rate is very high. 

*Is it curable?
Yes it is curable in case of benign tumors but in case of malignant cancers the prognosis is very poor. 


*Which doctor will do a breast biopsy? 
Usually it is a general surgeon, radiologist or pathologist who performs a breast biopsy. However, now there are   surgeons with special interest in breast surgery.

*Will my breast get disfigured after biopsy?      
No, the breast will not get disfigured after biopsy procedure.

*Is anesthesia needed for a breast biopsy?      
The patient needs no anesthesia or just a local anesthesia during non-surgical biopsies.     However, the patient may receive a local or general anesthesia for surgical biopsies.

*Is breast biopsy painful?      
Except for a minor sting from the injected anesthesia, patients usually feel no pain before or during a procedure. After the procedure, some patients may experience some soreness and pain. Usually, an over-the-counter drug is sufficient to alleviate the discomfort.

*What is X-ray guided breast biopsy?      
X-ray guided breast biopsy is also known as stereotactic biopsy. During this procedure, a computerized mammography machine uses intersecting coordinates to pinpoint the area of tissue change. 
X-ray guided breast biopsy is done when mammogram shows a suspicious mass that cannot be felt on breast examination, or a suspicious cluster of small calcium deposits, when the structure of breast tissue is distorted. 


*Who is the best doctor to treat my disease?
Any surgeon who has an interest in treating breast cancer can help you. However, if the cancer has spread, an Oncologist is the best person to be approached.

*What should I do to prevent breast cancer?
It would not cure the cancer all together, but it can keep the cancer "in remission" for a period of time. Also, chemotherapy is used to prevent symptoms from occurring and is used to help one feel more "comfortable" although the cancer may still be in progress. 
a. Regular self breast examination after the age of *
b. If there is a strong family history of breast cancer, one should have a regular mammogarm after the age of *
c. Leading a healthy lifestyle will help prevent breast cancer. 

*When is chemotherapy used as treatment option?
Chemotherapy will be used anytime once cancer cells are diagnosed in the body's circulation. Chemotherapy would be used to keep the cancer from spreading. 

*How does chemotherapy work?
Chemotherapy is a "systemic" therapy. This means that the drugs will go throughout your body and theoretically kill all cancer cells within your body. But certain chemotherapy drugs are known to kill certain types of cancer cells, therefore, the chemotherapy drugs are selected according to the type of cancer one is affected with. 

*How is chemotherapy given?
Most chemotherapy is given intravenously (IV) so that it reaches directly into the blood system. This allows the drugs to be rapidly absorbed and destroys the cancer fast. Sometimes chemotherapy can be given in a pill form. 

*What are the effects of radiation treatment?
External radiation therapy does not cause one's body to become radioactive. There is no need to avoid being with other people because of treatment. Even hugging, kissing, or having sexual relations poses no risk of radiation exposure. Approximately **weeks after the first radiation treatment, one may experience changes to skin areas of the chest wall and breast. These changes are an expected part of the therapy and are temporary. 

*Are all breast lumps cancerous?
Most breast lumps are benign (not cancerous). They cannot spread outside of the breast to other organs. Fibrocystic changes usually cause most of these lumps. Fibrosis refers to excessive formation of scar-like connective tissue; cysts are fluid-filled sacs. Women with fibrocystic changes often experience breast swelling and pain. The breasts may feel lumpy and the nipple may discharge a clear or slightly cloudy green or gray fluid. Fibroadenomas or papillomas are common breast lumps. 

*Which doctors do mammography?
Mammography is done by a radiologist. Your physician could guide you to a radiologist in your area who does the test.

*What happens if the mammography test comes abnormal?
If the mammogram comes abnormal, the woman may have to undergo further radiological tests and maybe a biopsy to rule out breast cancer.

*Does mammography have any side effects?
Mammography may cause anxiety and slight pain during the procedure. It also exposes the woman to radiation. However, the dose of the radiation is very low and the benefits of the procedure outweigh the risks. The results of the test may not be *accurate. Some breast abnormalities other than cancer may appear suspicious on mammogram. Thus the woman may be subjected to further unnecessary tests. Mammograms may also not yield correct results in women with breast implants.

*Which doctor should I consult if I have a breast lump?
 Consult a general Surgeon. 

*I find a lump in my breast should I wait to see if it wanes or consult a doctor?
If you find that there is something unusual in your breast it would be appropriate to consult your doctor right away.

*If my breasts feel lumpy despite the doctor saying that it is only a cyst what should I do?
If worried it is better to get a second opinion.

*I always have lumpy breasts. What then is normal?
The trick is to familiarize yourself with your breasts. Anything unusual must be subjected to medical examination. However there is no reason to panic, as the vast majority of these lumps are benign.


*Which doctor specialist should I see if I need to be screened for a breast lump?
Seek an appointment with a General Surgeon or a surgeon who has special interest in breast surgery. 

*Does preventive surgeries guarantee against breast cancer?
 No it does not. It reduces the risks considerably. However the surgeries cannot completely rue out cancer development.

*If I am BRCA positive does that mean I will develop cancer later on?
 Being BRCA positive does not mean that you will definitely develop cancer. It only puts you at a higher risk and must be treated as a sign of warning.

*Are BRCA genes found in everyone? 
 Yes they are. BRCA genes are tumor suppressor genes and they survey our system for abnormalities. One of the reason why cancer develops is because these genes undergo mutations. 


*Which doctor should I consult if I am diagnosed with breech presentation of the baby?
You should consult a Gynecologist 

*What is breech presentation?
By around *months, most babies settle down in head down position, known as a cephalic presentation. A baby is said to be in breech presentation when the buttocks of the baby are presenting first at the bottom of the uterus.

*Why does Breech Presentation occur? 
In most cases of breech presentation no direct cause is found. Conditions that will make a breech presentation more likely include abnormalities of the womb such as fibroids, twin pregnancy, a low-lying afterbirth (placenta) and a premature delivery.

*What is moxibustion?
Moxibustion is Traditional Chinese medicine that uses burning herbs to stimulate acupuncture points, and it may be helpful in turning breech babies when applied to the little toe. Its effect may be through increasing fetal activity.

*What is meant by External cephalic version?
If your baby is in a breech position, your doctor may try turning him around by pushing strategically on your belly so that it's in the head down position. This procedure is called external cephalic version, and it is usually done in a hospital setting where the baby's heart rate can be carefully monitored.

*Can a breech baby be delivered without a cesarean?
Although breech babies can be delivered vaginally, it's generally safer and easier to deliver babies head first from the vagina. So, many times doctors deliver breech babies by cesarean delivery.


*Whom should we consult if we have Bruxism?
You should consult a Dentist. The dentist examines your mouth and jaw for signs of bruxism, such as jaw tenderness and abnormalities in your teeth.

*How do we find out if we have Bruxism?
Bruxism often happens during sleep, so most people are unaware that they grind their teeth. However, a dull, constant headache or sore jaws are symptoms of bruxism. Many people get to know from their bed partners that they grind their teeth in the night. 

*My son is ten and he occasionally grinds his teeth at night, when will he outgrow this habit?
The good news is most children outgrow bruxism. The grinding gets less between the ages **and children tend to stop grinding between ages **

*Why does he grind his teeth, his sister does not seem to suffer from a similar problem?
Children react differently to certain situations. One theory as to the cause involves a psychological component. Stress due to a new environment, divorce, changes at school; etc. can influence a child to grind their teeth. Another theory relates to pressure in the inner ear at night. If there are pressure changes (like in an airplane during take-off and landing when people are chewing gum, etc. to equalize pressure) the child will grind by moving his jaw to relieve this pressure. 

*Does my son need therapy?
You will have to consult a dentist who will assess the extent of damage to the teeth. The majority of cases of pediatric bruxism do not require any treatment. If excessive wear of the teeth is present, then a mouth guard may be indicated. The negatives to a mouth guard are the possibility of choking if the appliance becomes dislodged during sleep and it may interfere with growth of the jaws. The positive is obvious by preventing wear to the primary dentition. 


*What is Bulimia?
Bulimia Nervosa is an Eating Disorder, the characteristic feature of which is an irresistible urge to overeat followed by the compensatory action of self-induced vomiting or purging to avoid weight gain.

*Does having a history of bulimia affect a woman's chances of getting pregnant? 
Bulimia causes irregular periods in women. But there is no evidence that it could affect a woman's chances of getting pregnant after she recovers from the disorder.

*What happens if a woman having Bulimia gets pregnant? 
If a woman actively suffering from bulimia gets pregnant then the following complications may occur 


*Which specialist should I see if I have Burns?
You should immediately consult a general physician / general surgeon.

*What is the prognosis of burn injury?

 Arthritis
 Guillain-Barr Syndrome (GBS) 

*How long does the carrier phase of campylobacteriosis last?
Infected people continue to pass the germ in their feces for a few days to a week or more. Antibiotics may shorten the carrier phase.

*What can be done for the prevention of campylobacteriosis?
The following measures should be undertaken to prevent campylobacteriosis-
 Always handle raw poultry, beef and pork with proper care. 
 Refrigerate raw products promptly.
 Wash the cutting boards and counters used for preparation.
 Avoid eating raw or undercooked meat. Ensure that the correct internal cooking temperature is reached.
 Avoid consuming unpasteurized milk or milk products.
 There should be proper disposal of sewage and the water sources should be protected from contamination.
 Encourage personal hygiene like careful hand washing before and after food preparation. Ensure that children wash their hands, particularly after handling pets. 

*Whom should I consult for treatment of cancer pain?
You can consult your oncologist who will prescribe pain relief medications or refer you to a pain specialist.

*Do opioid analgesics used to treat cancer pain cause addiction?
People who are prescribed opioid analgesics for pain relief do not get addicted to them.However, they do become physically dependent and may experience withdrawal symptoms if the opioid analgesic is withdrawn suddenly. Most people easily stop using the opioid analgesics once the cancer is cured. 


*What is marihuana? 
Marihuana is an assortment of the dried and shredded leaves, stems, seeds, and flowers of the hemp plant scientifically called Cannabis Sativa.

*Where did the word 'marijuana' come from?
The word 'marijuana' is a Mexican slang term that became popular in the late *in America, following a series of media and government programs, which are now commonly referred to as the Reefer Madness Movement

*How is it used? 
It is generally used in the form of a cigarette, but many users have various ways to use the drug, and many also use it in preparation of food, or often use it while making tea.

*Is Marihuana addictive?
It is generally considered more a habit-forming drug than an addictive drug. People who use it in long-term tend to get habituated, meaning, they use the drug compulsively even though it often interferes with family, school, work, and other activities. 

*What is the meaning of "feeling high"? 
It is the term used by the people who have smoked marijuana to describe the effect. They exhibit a sense of well-being or euphoria and tend to be more talkative, laugh for frivolous reasons, alternating with periods of introspective dreaminess, followed by lethargy and sleepiness. The typical feature of high in marijuana is an alteration in time sense along with short-term memory and learning lapse.

*What causes this effect?
THC, a chemical that the drug produces travels in the blood through the lungs into the brain, binding with specific receptors to cause the effects. 

*How long does the drug stay in the body?
Marijuana stays in the system longer than most of the other drugs. This is mainly due to the metabolites of marijuana that get attached to the fat cells in the body, and hence secreted much slower than most drugs. 


*Who performs the cardiac catheterization? 
A cardiologist or a radiologist performs cardiac catheterization procedure

*How long does a cardiac catheterization take? 
You will be in the Cath lab for about an hours time at least, including preparation and the actual procedure. Several hours may be required to do catheterization as a therapeutic procedure. 

*Can I have a cardiac catheterization if Im allergic to dyes? 
Most often, antihistamines and steroids can be given as a pretreatment to patients with previous allergic reactions to the contrast dye. This pretreatment should suffice in bringing down the risk of an adverse reaction to a minimum. 

*Am I being exposed to too much radiation during this procedure? 
Since this procedure has live X-ray imaging, patients will be exposed to a small amount of radiation. However, it is not very harmful at these levels. Doctors and staff present in the lab protect themselves by wearing lead aprons. 


*Which specialist doctor manages a case of Cardiomyopathy in the long run?
A cardiologist manages cases of Cardiomyopathy

*What sort of emergency should I anticipate if I have Cardiomyopathy?
If you develop chest pain, palpitations, faintness or difficulty in breathing it means that the heart failure is progressing and in this situation you should seek emergency medical treatment in a hospital.

*What is the outlook of Cardiomyopathy in children?
One third will improve, one third will progress and another one third will die due to the disease.

*Can Cardiomyopathy be cured?
Cardiomyopathy usually cannot be cured. It can be controlled by medication. If the cause is taken care off only then cure maybe possible. 

*If I have Cardiomyopathy what can I do to help the condition?
Avoid smoking and drinking alcohol as these may make the symptom worse. Weigh yourself everyday  if you suddenly find that your weight has increased  it means that you are retaining fluid and maybe developing heart failure. This could be an early sign to seek treatment. 

*Who treats Cat Scratch Disease (CSD)?
The treatment of CSD is symptomatic. Hence the following group of doctors are employed in the treatment of CSD:

Infectious disease specialist
Ophthalmologist (in neuroretinitis)
Neurologist (in encephalitis or seizures)

*What is Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome?
It is a condition caused by conjunctival inoculation and ear inflammation (ipsilateral preauricular lymphadenitis).

*When must an affected person see a doctor?
When enlarged lymph nodes are seen after exposure to a cat it is better to consult a doctor.

*How can CSD be prevented?
Avoiding contact with cats, or washing hands thoroughly after playing with cats, can lessen the risk of infection.

*Which doctor should I visit when I develop cataract?
You should consult an Ophthalmologist.

*What is an intraocular lens (IOL)?
In most cataract surgeries, the removed lens is replaced by an intraocular lens (IOL). An IOL is a clear, artificial lens that requires no care and becomes a permanent part of your eye. With an IOL, you will have improved vision because light will be able to pass through to the retina. Also, you will not feel or see the new lens. There are three types of IOL 
Monofocal i.e. fixed strength lenses which are set for one level of vision, usually distance vision 
Multifocal lenses, which allow two or more different strengths, like near and distance vision 
Accommodating lenses, which allow the eye to focus on both near and distant objects. They function similar to the natural human lens.

*What are the common problems encountered after surgery?
Problems after surgery rarely occur. These can include infection, bleeding, inflammation, light flashes, double vision and low or high eye pressure. The risk of retinal detachment resulting in permanent vision loss increases slightly after surgery. These problems can be treated with prompt medical attention.
Sometimes, the eye tissue that encloses the IOL may become cloudy and blur the vision. This condition is called after-cataract and can develop months or years after cataract surgery. It is treated with laser (YAG laser capsulotomy). The doctor uses a laser to make a tiny hole in the eye tissue behind the lens to let light pass through. 
Toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS), an acute, noninfectious inflammation of the anterior segment of the eye can occur after cataract extraction (anterior segment eye surgery). Contaminants, usually from surgical equipment or supplies, have been cited as the cause of TASS. TASS can be treated successfully with topical steroids, topical non steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, or both. 

*How soon can vision return to normal?
Improvement in vision usually begins within *or *days of surgery. As the eye takes time to heal from surgery, for complete improvement in vision, it can take up to *weeks after surgery.

*Can a cataract return?
A cataract cannot return because all or part of the lens has been removed. However, in some people who have undergone extracapsular surgery or phacoemulsification, the lens capsule becomes cloudy after a year. It causes the same vision problems as a cataract does. To correct this, laser capsulotomy can be performed. In laser (YAG) capsulotomy, a laser (light) beam is used to make a tiny hole in the capsule to let light pass. This surgery is painless and does not require stay in the hospital. 

*Which doctor should I see if I suspect that my child has Celiac Disease?
Visit a pediatrician or a gastro-enterologist in your area. Also consult a dietician.

*How can I ensure I get the latest information about this condition?
Become a member of a support group. Example - medindia support group http://www.medindia.net/healthnetwork/support-groups/allergy/resources.htm 


*Is there a screening for Celiac disease?
Yes you can get screened for the disease by doing a blood test to check for antibodies. 

*What are the other common food allergies among children?
These include lactose food allergy  e.g milk, and dairy products. Other common food allergies are as follows 
	soy 
	shellfish 
	Gluten or due to wheat 
	peanuts 
	egg whites 

*What are Celiac Disease Support Group ?
Support groups are a group of people suffering from the same condition  like yours. Over here you can find how to cope with day to day problems and discuss issues that you may not be able to discuss with your doctors. Many support groups now have their own websites. Celiac disease is one of the commonest conditions that are never discovered. If you think you or someone you know may have this condition, it would be worth joining these groups. 


*Which doctor should I consult for treating cellulite?
You must consult a dermatologist.

*Does liposuction help improve the appearance of cellulite?

*Which doctor should I see to consult on cervical cancer?
You should see a gynecologist or a gynecologic oncologist for your problem.

*I have a single sex partner. Do I need to do a pap test?
Cervical cancer is more common among women with multiple partners and also among women whose partners have several partners. It is therefore important for all women who are sexually active to undergo routine screening to prevent its onset.

*Why does having multiple sex partners increase the incidence of cervical cancer?
The Human Papilloma Virus spreads through sex. The infection by this virus is very prevalent in the community and the current data from CDC estimates that about *million people in the U.S. are infected with HPV. Having multiple sex partners increases the chance of suffering from the infection and hence makes the women more prone to cervical cancer. However it should also be known that HPV is only a risk factor for the occurrence of cancer and not all women with HPV infection develop cervical cancer.

*At what age should Gardasil be administered?
The FDA has approved Gardasil for girls and women between *and *years. 

*If my mother had cervical cancer - Do I have risk of this cancer?
Cervical cancer is caused by many factors. Unlike breast cancer which can be inherited cervical cancer is not known to be inherited. 

*Is cervcial smear or Pap smear painful?
No Pap smear test is not painful. There maybe mild discomfort and light spotting for a day or two. If the procedure is painful or the spotting heavy - you should make sure there is no underlying infection. 

*Is the Pap smear very acurate in detecting cancer?
Yes Pap smear is very reliable. However no test is *foolproof. Many labs follow a double reporting system to check for errors. 


*What is Cervical Spondylosis?
Cervical Spondylosis is a degenerative disease affecting the joints of the cervical vertebrae (Bones of the back of neck) with deposition of minerals in the discs (cushions) , which is present in   between the vertebral bones.

Activities like reading and writing for prolonged period demands a continuous muscle and ligaments tension and can result in neck strain. Some of the activities that cause gradual strain of the structures of the neck leading to neck pain and stiffness include-
Habit of holding the telephone on one shoulder and leaning at it for long time
Sitting or standing still for long period
Use of poorly designed desks and chairs can cause abnormal stress to the neck 
Driving continuously for long hours
Sleeping in awkward position and with many pillows below the neck and shoulder

*Suggest a home based simple posture exercise?
Stand in front of the mirror with your back touching the walls. Try to push the wall with your back and neck. This exercise will correct your posture. 


*Which doctors treat Charcot foot?
Charcot foot is usually treated by an orthopedist or a podiatrist (foot specialist).

*What is the outcome of treatment in a patient with Charcot foot?
A patient with Charcot foot usually recovers completely if the condition has been diagnosed early.  In other cases, the patient may have deformities and require custom made shoes to prevent recurrent ulceration.

*Which bones affected by Charcot foot heal the fastest?
Bones of the forefoot usually heal the fastest as compared to the ankle, midfoot or hindfoot.

*Why are all deformities of Charcot foot not treated with surgery?
Patients with Charcot foot are usually patients with long-standing diabetes.  Surgery is associated with prolonged healing times as well as complications in these patients.  Hence, surgery should be avoided as far as possible.

*What are the newer treatments being tried out for Charcot foot?
Some of the newer treatments being tried out in patients with Charcot foot are bisphosphonates, low-intensity ultrasound and the use of electrical stimulation and magnetic field therapy.  However, more studies are necessary before these can be recommended as routine treatments for Charcot foot. 



*Who will give chemotherapy treatment?
An oncologist is the doctor who will administer the treatment.

*Is chemotherapy compulsory while treating cancer?
No it is not.It depends on the type and stage of the cancer. In some cases there may be a wait-and-watch policy; in others it is given to cure the disease or to prevent its recurrence.

*Do side effects occur in all patients?
They occur in the vast majority of the patients but can be controlled using medicines.

*How will I be feeling during treatment?
You are likely to feel tired but this will stop after a while and you will be able to lead a normal life. However this largely depends on the individuals being treated.

Chest pain is a general term used to describe pain in the chest region for which there are many reasons. However angina is chest pain that arises due to heart-related problems.

*Is it necessary to take chest pain seriously?
Yes it is important to take chest pain seriously until proven otherwise. 

*Are heart diseases curable? 
Heart diseases are not curable but they are definitely treatable. 

*When is chest pain an emergency?
